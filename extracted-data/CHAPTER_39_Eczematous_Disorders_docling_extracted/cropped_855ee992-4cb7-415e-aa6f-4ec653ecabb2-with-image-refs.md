## Defi  nition and nomenclature

Eczema, a term derived from the Greek word ' ε′κζεμα ' meaning 'to boil', is a clinical and histological pattern of infl  ammation of the skin seen in a variety of dermatoses with widely diverse aetiologies.  Clinically,  eczematous  dermatoses  are  characterized  by variable intensity of itching and soreness, and, in variable degrees, a  range  of  signs  including  dryness,  erythema,  excoriation,  exudation, fi  ssuring, hyperkeratosis, lichenifi  cation, papulation, scaling and vesiculation. Histologically, the clinical signs are refl  ected by a range of epidermal changes including spongiosis (epidermal oedema) with varying degrees of acanthosis and hyperkeratosis, accompanied by a lymphohistiocytic infi  ltrate in the dermis.

## ynonyms and inclusions S [  1,2  ]

- ·    The terms 'dermatitis' and 'eczema' are generally regarded as synonymous, although some authors still use the term 'dermatitis' to include all types of cutaneous infl  ammation, so that all eczema is dermatitis, but not all dermatitis is eczema. Some caution is required when using the term 'dermatitis', as some patients regard it as implying an occupational cause. Consensus meetings are ongoing regarding international agreement on the use of these terms.

n  order  to  structure  our  understanding  of  the  large  number  of I eczematous dermatoses, a number of classifi  cation systems have been advanced. Classifi  cation  based  on  aetiology  has  been  proposed and is a useful system where the cause is clear, for example patch test-proven allergic contact dermatitis. However, frequently the aetiology is unclear or, for example in hand eczema, there are a number of probable aetiologies in an individual patient. Another option is to use the morphology of the condition as a classifi  cation, for example in the case of nummular dermatitis where 'nummular' is derived from the Latin word 'nummus', which means 'coin'. However, one morphological pattern of eczema can have a variety of causes, for example pompholyx eczema can be due to irritant or allergic contact dermatitis. In addition, the morphology of an acute presentation, which tends to be oedematous and exudative (Figure   39.1  a), may differ from chronic eczema, in which the predominant features are dryness, hyperkeratosis and lichenifi  cation (Figure   39.1  b).

More  recently,  the  International  Statistical  Classifi  cation  of Diseases  and  Related  Health  Problems  11th  Revision  (ICD-11) is  moving  towards  a  composite  system  based  on  aetiology, where  known,  and  skin  site.  Box  39.1  provides  a  list  of  the eczematous  dermatoses  split  into  those  with  a  known  exogenous trigger and those that are thought to be more endogenous. Management of exogenous eczemas is to  remove  the  cause  if possible,  whereas  endogenous  eczemas  more  often  require pharmacological    intervention.  All  of  the  conditions  listed  are defi  ned and described in further detail in this and subsequent chapters. Some disorders in which the predominant feature is

lichenifi  cation are generally regarded as eczematous dermatoses and these are also included in this chapter. Eczema is the commonest cause of erythroderma and so this clinical presentation is described here.

There remain cases of eczema that do not fi  t any of the described patterns  [  3  ].  These  are  not  uncommon  and  have  been  termed 'unclassifi  ed  eczema' [  4  ].  These  patients  may  have  a  poor  prognosis, with a tendency for the disease to become chronic. It is not unusual to see generalized, apparently endogenous, but otherwise unclassifi  ed eczema in the elderly [  5  ].

## pidemiology E

## Incidence and prevalence

Eczematous dermatoses account for a large proportion of all skin disease. There have been numerous studies of the prevalence of atopic eczema (see Chapter   41  ), but fewer in other types of eczema. A survey of the prevalence of skin disease was carried out in the USA on a sample of over 20 000 people who were representative

of the whole population, and who were examined meticulously for  skin  disease  by  trained  observers  [  6  ].  Nearly  one-third  had some signifi  cant skin pathology. The point prevalence of all forms of eczema was 18 per 1000, seven of whom had atopic eczema. Hand eczema, dyshidrotic eczema and nummular eczema each accounted for about two per 1000. In a population-based survey of public health issues in Stockholm, Sweden, a postal questionnaire  was  sent  to  15 000  adult  inhabitants.  Fifteen  per  cent  of respondents reported a history of childhood eczema. The 1-year prevalence of hand eczema was 8%, skin symptoms on the face were present in 14% and allergy to nickel was reported in 15% of females [  7  ].  Population-based studies of contact allergic dermatitis suggest 40% of subjects demonstrate at least one contact allergic reaction [  8  ].

The  Royal  College  of  General  Practitioners  Birmingham,  UK Research  Unit  Weekly  Returns  Unit  data  for  2006  reported  the 1-year period prevalence of non-atopic eczema to be 25 per 1000 population [ 9 .  Consultations for eczema are a major part of the ] workload in primary care. Horn [  10  ] recorded the details of 6819 dermatological consultations in a UK general practice of 3000-4000 patients  from  1958  to  1985.  Eczema  patients  formed  the  largest group (19% of the consultations). In a general practice in Belfast, 8% of patients seen during an 8-week period had a dermatological condition. Eczema accounted for 25% of these, of which 63% were considered to be exogenous in origin [  11  ].

n addition, many cases of eczema are referred to hospital. In the I UK, eczema consultations account for 10% of the total secondary care dermatology caseload [    ]. A national tertiary referral centre in 9 Singapore described the profi  le of eczema referred between 1989 and 1990 [  12  ]; 25 448 new cases were analysed. These represented 34% of new cases seen at the centre. Sixty-seven per cent of eczema

cases were classifi  ed as endogenous and 13.7% were contact dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis comprised 0.5% of all eczemas. The authors commented on the increase in the proportion of endogenous eczema seen in 1989-90 compared with that reported in 1973.

## Age and sex

Certain subtypes of eczema can be seen more commonly in particular  age  groups.  Most  cases  of  eczema  in  infants  and  young children are atopic. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) epidemiological survey in the USA [  13  ], atopic  eczema  was  by  far  the  most  common  form  found  up  to the age of 11 years; discoid (nummular) and 'dyshidrotic' eczema were recorded, but were much less frequent. Perioral eczema is common in children with atopic eczema (see Chapter   41  ), but it can also occur in non-atopic children. Hand eczema is common in atopic children and uncommon in non-atopic children. Several specifi  c patterns of eczematous change are predominantly found in children; for example, juvenile plantar dermatosis and napkin dermatitis.

Pompholyx  and  atopic  eczema  are  less  common  in  elderly people, while other forms of eczema assume greater importance. Nummular dermatitis occurs particularly in elderly males in winter,  and  asteatotic  eczema  of  the  legs  is  also  common.  In  older factory workers, irritant hand eczema can be very troublesome, although allergic  contact  dermatitis  becomes  less  common  with advancing age. The subject is discussed more fully in Chapter   128  .

## Ethnicity

Eczematous dermatoses are reported in all ethnic groups but data are limited regarding ethnic differences for non-atopic eczema.

## Associated diseases

Atopic eczema is associated with some forms of non-atopic eczematous dermatoses, in particular hand eczema (see Chapter   41  ).

## Pathophysiology

There has been considerable research on the pathogenesis of some types of eczema, particularly allergic contact dermatitis, primary irritant contact dermatitis and atopic eczema  . One particular challenge  in  this  research  fi  eld  has  been  distinguishing  non-specifi  c common pathways from specifi  c mechanisms. The interaction of trigger  factors,  keratinocytes  and  T  lymphocytes  seems  particularly important in most eczema types.

Allergic contact dermatitis represents a reproducible model of eczema development [  14  ],  as  discussed  in  Chapter    128  .  Eczema may also be provoked in a non-allergic manner, as in irritant contact dermatitis. Three predominant processes occurring in irritant dermatitis are disturbed barrier function, epidermal cell change and release of infl  ammatory mediators and cytokines.

Certain  irritants  may  provoke  a  chronic  reaction  in  which  an effect on epidermal cell turnover predominates, leading to lichenification; whereas in acute irritant reactions infl  ammatory mediator and cytokine release is similar to that seen in acute allergic contact dermatitis [  15  ].  There  is  debate  whether  the  cytokine profi  les  of the two reactions differ [  15-17  ]. Indeed, it has been proposed that irritant reactions to haptens may be required to facilitate contact sensitization [  18  ].

After  activation  of  the  immune  pathway  by  cytokine  release, the accumulation of infl  ammatory cells progresses, leading to the morphological changes that are apparent histologically and clinically.  The  histological  changes of primary irritant dermatitis are similar to those seen in allergic contact dermatitis  , but they appear to proceed more quickly, depending on the concentration of the irritant used. Both intracellular and intercellular oedema are visible throughout the epidermis at 3-6 h, and within 24 h there may be epidermal necrosis, with cellular vacuolation and nuclear pyknosis. In severe forms, the primary epidermal damage may progress to subepidermal blister formation.

As  discussed  later  in  this  chapter  and  in  Chapter    41  ,  genetic studies have demonstrated the importance of fi  laggrin, a 37 kDa intracellular  protein  that  binds  to  and  condenses  the  keratin cytoskeleton, resulting in squame formation [  19  ]. Loss-of-  function mutations  of  the  fi  llaggrin  gene  result  in  impaired  skin  barrier function and are linked to atopic eczema and some subtypes of non-atopic eczema.

## Predisposing factors

These will be discussed in relation to each subtype of eczema in the relevant sections of this chapter.

## Pathology

The  histopathological  features  of  eczema,  in  common  with  the clinical features, are variable, and depend particularly on whether the disease is acute or chronic [  20-23  ].

n  the  acute  phase  (Figure    39.2  a),  the  histological  picture  is I dominated by spongiosis, an intercellular epidermal oedema that leads to stretching and eventual rupture of the intercellular attachments, with the formation of vesicles. The epidermal vesicles commonly occur in discrete foci, but on the palms and soles they tend to become large by coalescence. There is variable infi  ltration of the epidermis by lymphocytes. Increased epidermal mitotic activity leads to acanthosis but, if spongiosis is intense, disintegration of the suprapapillary epidermis may cause clefts to form. The intercellular oedema may be diffuse, but is commonly most intense in the mid-epidermal region. Loosening and disruption of the individual  cells  occurs  and  some  intracellular  vacuolation  may  be found, with displacement of the nucleus from the centre of the cell. Loose, shrunken epidermal cells may resemble histiocytes. Vesicles and the oedematous epidermis may be permeated by mononuclear cells, chiefl  y monocytes.

In the subacute stage (Figure   39.2  b), spongiosis and vesiculation diminish and increasing acanthosis is associated with formation of a parakeratotic horny layer. This often contains layers of coagulated plasma and pyknotic nuclei of infl  ammatory cells.

In chronic  eczema  (Figure    39.2  c),  hyperkeratosis  gradually replaces  parakeratosis.  Acanthosis  is  more  prominent  than spongiosis. Infl  ammatory cells are less evident in the epidermis, but  dermal  changes  become  more  prominent.  The  rete  ridges become  elongated  and  broadened,  changes  are  then  those  of lichenifi  cation.

V ascular  dilatation  in  the  dermis  is  marked  in  all  stages.  The papillary  vessels  are  particularly  involved,  and  in  lichenifi  cation  they  may  become  tortuous.  The  infi  ltrate  is  predominantly lymphohistiocytic,  although  polymorphs  and  eosinophils  may

Cook, Guildford, Surrey, UK.)

be present in very acute eczema and eosinophils are particularly common in eczematous drug eruptions. In the presence of infection, polymorphs may invade the epidermis. In grossly lichenifi  ed eczema, prurigo and exfoliative dermatitis, the infi  ltrate is mixed and may be so dense that it simulates a granuloma.

The trauma of rubbing or scratching may cause superfi  cial erosions, haemorrhage or subepidermal fi  brinoid changes. Although some degree of lichenifi  cation is always present during a prolonged attack of eczema, it is particularly prominent in atopic eczema. At times, extreme hyperkeratosis and papillomatosis develop.

With  secondary  infection,  the  formation  of  follicular  or  subcorneal pustules can simulate the appearance of impetigo, although typical eczematous changes are still visible at the edges of the lesion.

Although spongiosis and a dermal lymphohistiocytic infi  ltrate are always present at some stage in eczema, the dynamic nature of  the  changes and their modifi  cation by secondary events may make histological diagnosis diffi  cult. All the changes mentioned, with the exception of the spongiotic vesicle, may also be found in burns or simple traumatic lesions of the skin. The distinction between eczema and psoriasis can be especially diffi  cult, particularly on the palms and soles. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is particularly diffi  cult  to  distinguish  from  psoriasis,  but  the  fi  nding  of  Munro microabscesses is suggestive of the latter. It is generally true that cases which cause diagnostic diffi  culty clinically often have equivocal histological appearance. The histological features of pityriasis rosea are those of eczema, but the clinical features, particularly the distribution, are characteristic.

Other modifi  cations of the histopathological pattern in relation to different clinical subtypes of eczema are described later in this chapter.

## Causative organisms

Most  eczema  subtypes  are  not  thought  to  be  primarily  due  to infection although they may be complicated by secondary bacterial or viral infection. The exception is infective dermatitis, which is discussed in a separate section later in this chapter. The issue of staphylococcal colonization of the skin in atopic eczema and possible  eczema  exacerbation  by  staphylococcal  toxin  superantigen production is discussed in more detail in Chapter   41  .

## Genetics

Filaggrin  mutations  are  linked  to  hand  eczema,  irritant  contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis due to nickel and possibly other allergens [ 24 25 , ,26  ], as discussed in more detail in the relevant sections.

## Environmental factors

Irritants and allergens may act as triggers for irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis, respectively.

## Clinical features

## History

The hallmark of eczema in terms of symptoms is pruritus, which may disturb sleep and other elements of quality of life and can affect other family members profoundly as well. When taking the

history, it is important to note occupation and recreational activities because these may be relevant in terms of irritant and allergen exposures.

## Presentation

Acute eczema presents as an eruption that is typically oedematous,  vesicular  and  may  be  exudative.  In  chronic  eczema,  these features give way to a more stable picture of erythema, scaling, excoriation  and  lichenifi  cation.  The  specifi  c  presentation  of  different  subtypes  of  non-atopic  eczema  will  be  discussed  in  later ections of this chapter. s econdary dissemination. S A characteristic feature of eczematous infl  ammation is its tendency to spread far from its point of origin and to become generalized [  27  ]. This phenomenon is often termed autosensitization  or,  more  specifi  cally,  autoeczematization  [  28  ]. Generalized spread is especially likely when the primary site of the eczema is on the legs or the feet. There is also a tendency for an eruption beginning on the feet to extend to the hands and vice versa. The eczema may have been present for only a few days, or for many years, before dissemination occurs. The dissemination, which is often preceded by an exacerbation at the primary site, often occurs rapidly. The secondary eruption may at fi  rst consist of  small oedematous papules, but these soon become obviously eczematous and grouped papulovesicles may become confl  uent in small plaques. Occasionally, the lesions take the form of red macules or weals. The distribution is usually symmetrical.

The course of the secondary eruption depends largely on the progress  of  the  primary  lesion.  If  the  primary  lesion  remains acutely  infl  amed,  the  eruption  increases  in  severity  and  may become generalized. If the patient is rested and the local lesion is allowed to settle, the secondary eruption will subside, but will often recur very readily if the local lesion relapses. In a small proportion  of  patients,  the  generalized  secondary  eruption  evolves into erythroderma, which may become self-perpetuating.

Conditioned  hyperirritability. This refers  to  the  phenomenon whereby an area of infl  amed skin on one part of the body results in a generalized hyperirritability of the skin at distant sites. There is  considerable evidence that eczematous patients are more vulnerable  to  mild  primary  irritants  than  are  unaffected  people. Conditioned  hyperirritability  seems  to  be  associated  with  any focal  infl  ammation  of  the  skin,  and  it  may  explain  some  clinical phenomena such as the tendency for patients suffering from eczema, especially acute eczema, to have a higher proportion of false  positive    'irritant'  reactions  to  patch  tests.  The  'angry  back' syndrome, in which a strongly positive patch test response can increase the percentage of false positive reactions on the back at the same time, is an example of this.

There may be several mechanisms underlying the dissemination of eczema  and  conditioned  hyperirritability.  Circulating activated T lymphocytes are increased in number [  29,30  ]. In addition,  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells  show  increased  proliferation  in  the  presence  of  an  autologous  skin  homogenate  as compared with control subjects. This suggests that an abnormal cell-  mediated immune response against autologous skin antigens could be occurring [  31,32  ].

## Differential diagnosis

This will be discussed in relation to each non-atopic eczema subtype covered later in this chapter.

## Classifi  cation of severity

While  a  large  number  of  severity  measurement  scales  exist  for atopic  eczema,  there  are  relatively  few  available  for  non-atopic eczema.

## Complications and co-morbidities

A reduction in skin barrier function increases the risk of both bacterial and viral secondary skin infection. However, eczema herpeticum is linked primarily to atopic eczema and fi  laggrin mutations (see Chapter   41  ).

## Disease course and prognosis

Eczema  tends  to  follow  a  chronic  relapsing  remitting  course. Issues specifi  c to each non-atopic eczema subtype will be covered later in this chapter.

## nvestigations I

Most cases of eczema can be diagnosed clinically. It can sometimes be  helpful  to  measure  the  total  IgE  level  in  order  to  determine whether an individual is atopic, particularly when the distribution of eczema is atypical and there is no background of other atopic illness.  Secondary  infection  can  be  confi  rmed  by  taking  swabs for culture and sensitivity to identify the causative organism and any  bacterial  resistance,  such  as  meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). When dermatophyte infection is suspected, a potassium hydroxide preparation should be examined or scrapings sent to a laboratory for microscopy and culture. Microscopy, or  dermoscopic  examination  of  the  skin,  can  also  be  helpful  to confi  rm a diagnosis of scabies, which is easy to miss in a patient with pre-existing  eczema.  Biopsy  can  occasionally  be  helpful  in confi  rming the eczematous nature of the eruption, and immunofluorescence  can  help  identify  less  common  conditions  such  as dermatitis herpetiformis or, in older patients, a non-bullous presentation of bullous pemphigoid.

## Patch testing in eczema [  33-35  ]

Routine  use  of  patch  testing  is  not  indicated  for  typical  presentations  of  endogenous  eczema  such  as  atopic  eczema,  pityriasis alba  and  seborrhoeic  eczema.  This  investigation  is  much  more important in atypical or asymmetrical eruptions, and especially in dermatitis affecting the face, hands and feet [  35  ].

n apparently endogenous eczema the threshold for patch testI ing should still be low. Sensitization commonly develops to topical medicaments, prescribed or self-administered, and this may exacerbate the eruption. Sometimes, topical remedies are concealed or forgotten by the patient, or the reaction they cause is partially suppressed by the concomitant use of topical corticosteroids. Sometimes, an unexpected positive test points to a 'hidden' or obscure cause,  for  example  fragrances,  preservatives,  vehicles,  epoxy  or rubber chemicals. Such substances are commonly encountered in the environment and in topical medication.

When a strong suspicion of a contact allergic cause for the eczema exists, it may be important to test with other potential allergens

in  addition  to  the  routine  battery  -  household  plants,  material extracted  from  footwear,  phosphorus  sesquisulphide,  acrylates, etc. The observer must be wary of false positive, irritant reactions, especially in the context of conditioned hyperirritability [  36  ]. For this reason it is always wise to allow the acute phase of eczema to subside before patch testing is carried out, or to repeat any positive tests when it has done so. If a contact urticaria is thought to be occurring, the patch tests should be read 1 h after application [  37  ].

Even if  a  positive  patch  test  is  judged  to  be  relevant,  it  does not  necessarily  follow  that  exclusion  of  the  substance  from  the patient's environment will result in a cure. The allergen may be only one of several contributory factors.

Although  patch  tests  are  designed  to  detect  allergens,  many substances give an irritant reaction when tested, and it is often difficult to be sure of the relevance of such a reaction to the patient's eczema. It must also be borne in mind that many topical medicaments can produce an irritant reaction, for example alcohol-based preparations  and  propylene  glycol.  The  choice  of  concentration of test substance and suitable vehicle are very important [  34  ] (see also Chapter   128 for details of patch testing).

## Management

During  history  taking  it  is  important  to  explore  previous  treatment experiences and gauge how much time and effort the patient will be able to devote to the care of their (or their child's) skin. An additional issue is the attitude of the patient to the risks and potential adverse effects associated with any treatment that may be required. A particularly common problem is an inappropriate level of anxiety about the use of topical corticosteroids.

A considerable variety of effective treatment modalities is available. These range from conservative and extremely safe approaches such as rest and the application of emollients, to more hazardous treatments such as phototherapy and systemic immunosuppressants.  Some  frequently  used  treatments  are  listed  in  Table    39.1  . When an extrinsic cause is identifi  ed or suspected this should be removed.  In  all  cases,  exposure  to  irritants  should  be  carefully avoided and the skin should be protected using emollients and appropriate  dressings.  Psychological  support  is  an  important aspect of management at all stages.

## Acute eczema

Acute eruptions and exacerbations of eczema cause great alarm and anxiety, and the stress of the situation is usually aggravated by loss of sleep caused by intense pruritus and soreness. Adequate rest is essential, and support from a dermatology day unit is very helpful. An  affected  leg  should  be  elevated  and  affected  hands should be used as little as possible.

Highly oedematous, vesicular and exudative eruptions such as pompholyx benefi  t from soaks in an astringent such as a 1 : 10 000 solution  of  potassium  permanganate,  or  alternatively  Burow's solution  BP,  which  contains  the  astringent  aluminium  acetate. Liberal  applications  of  bland  emollients  are  soothing.  Moderate or potent topical corticosteroids are generally used, at least for a few days, to speed resolution of acute episodes. Topical calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus may also have a role. Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% is probably similar in potency to potent topical corticosteroids [  38  ], while pimecrolimus has a lower

potency [  39  ].  When practical, tubular bandaging can be used to help keep topical medications in place. The wet wrapping technique,  in  which  a  layer  of  wet  tubular  bandage  (e.g.  Tubifast ® ) is  covered  with  a  dry  layer,  can  be  particularly  useful.  Hazards include a risk of hypothermia, although, in moderation, the cooling effect  is  highly  benefi  cial.  Emollients  and  other  medications can be applied under the bandaging as required. Penetration of topical corticosteroids can be signifi  cantly increased by this form of occlusion, enhancing both benefi  cial and adverse effects. Mild or moderate corticosteroids should be used for the face and genital areas. Potent or very potent corticosteroids are required, at least initially, for acute pompholyx on the hands or feet.

When  secondary  infection  is  present,  or  staphylococcal  contamination  of  the  skin  is  thought  to  be  an  aggravating  factor, oral antibiotics may be required. Topical preparations containing antibiotics  or  antiseptics  in  combination  with  steroids  can  also be  helpful.  These  compound  formulations  should  only  be  used when there is an indication for each constituent, in order to avoid unnecessary exposure to the risks of sensitization and emergence of bacterial resistance.

Excoriation can be reduced further by a sedative antihistamine such as hydroxyzine, and additional hypnotics may be needed for a few days to ensure sleep.

## Subacute eczema

f  an  acute  eczema  has  failed  to  clear  almost  completely  in  3-4 I weeks,  perpetuating  factors  such  as  exposure  to  a  sensitizing agent and concordance with treatment should be considered. Dermatology day unit review or admission to hospital can often be helpful in these circumstances. Paste bandages are of particular

value in occluding areas that are frequently excoriated, as in many lower  leg  eczemas.  These  must  be  applied  carefully  to  ensure that they are fi  rm but not tight enough to cause discomfort or to restrict blood fl  ow. Corticosteroids under polythene occlusion for a few days may be helpful at this stage to reduce pruritus. Topical immunomodulators such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are alternatives.

## Chronic eczema

First  line  therapy  for  chronic  eczema is the frequent application of emollients and avoidance of irritants such as soap and relevant allergens if identifi  ed. Daily application of topical corticosteroids is required to treat fl  ares, the choice of potency being determined by eczema severity, skin site and, in children, patient age. Once a fl  are has been treated successfully, the frequency of application of topical corticosteroids should be reduced gradually to prevent rebound fl  ares. A subsequent period of twice-weekly application may be needed to maintain remission in fl  are-prone individuals [  40  ].  T opical  calcineurin  inhibitors  are  applied  in  a  similar  way [  40  ] and may be needed to avoid skin atrophy for individuals who have had prolonged exposure to corticosteroids in areas such as the face.

Coal  tar  or  shale  tar  (ichthammol),  usually  applied  as  creams containing tar extracts or bandages impregnated with tar paste, can be soothing and reduce pruritus. Occlusive dressings and bandages may be useful.

V arious modalities of phototherapy have been used successfully in chronic eczema resistant to topical therapy, especially for atopic eczema. These include narrow-band UVB [  41  ], psoralen and UVA (PUVA) [  41  ] and UVA1 [  42  ].

n the most severe cases, oral immunosuppressive therapy may I be required. Systemic corticosteroids act rapidly, improving symptoms within a day or two, but there is the risk of eczema relapse when  treatment  is  discontinued  [  43  ].  Longer  term  treatment  is provided by ciclosporin [  43  ], azathioprine [  44  ] and methotrexate [  45  ].  Mycophenolate  mofetil  has  also  been  used,  but  evidence  is limited to pilot studies [  46  ]. All of these systemic modalities require careful monitoring. Alitretinoin, an oral retinoid, has recently been licensed  for  chronic  hand  eczema  following  a  large  randomized controlled trial [ 47 .  However, the evidence for use of photother-] apy and systemic immunosuppressants for non-atopic eczema is largely extrapolated from trials for atopic eczema (see Chapter   41  ).

## Nummular dermatitis

## Defi  nition and nomenclature

Nummular dermatitis  is  characterized  by  a  single,  non-specifi  c morphological feature, namely circular or oval plaques of eczema with a clearly demarcated edge. It should be distinguished from an irregular, patchy form of eczema in which the lesions are not clearly  demarcated.  The  condition  is  poorly  defi  ned,  however, because many eczema patients have one or two circular or oval lesions and few patients with nummular dermatitis have circular lesions alone [  1,2  ].

## ynonyms and inclusions S

- •    Discoid eczema
- •    Nummular eczema

## ntroduction and general description I

Nummular dermatitis is often referred to as discoid eczema. It tends to be a chronic problem, undergoing relapses and remissions. The evidence base for treatment is largely based on studies of atopic eczema, due to a paucity of studies specifi  cally investigating this subtype of non-atopic eczema.

## Epidemiology

## ncidence and prevalence I

A study of over 20 000 people, from 1 to 74 years of age, in the USA, who were examined for skin disease by trained observers, found the prevalence of nummular dermatitis to be two per 1000 [  3  ].

## Age

Nummular dermatitis tends to affect women in early adulthood, whereas in men onset is commonest in the older age groups.

## Associated diseases

Some authors have found a high incidence of atopy in patients with nummular dermatitis [  4  ], but others have not [  5  ], and levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) are often within the normal range [  6  ]. However, lesions of similar morphology may undoubtedly occur as part of atopic eczema.

## Pathophysiology

## Predisposing factors

See the section on associated diseases.

## Pathology [  7,8  ]

Histology usually shows a subacute dermatitis indistinguishable from other forms of eczema, with spongiotic vesicles and a predominantly lymphohistiocytic infi  ltrate. Eosinophils may also be present in the upper dermis.

Electron microscopic studies have shown that the intense intercellular oedema leads to a reduction in the number of desmosomes between the cells of the basal layer, whereas those in the stratum spinosum are mostly preserved.

## Causative organisms

Some authors have stressed the role of infection [  9,10  ]. As in other forms of eczema, heavy colonization of the lesions by staphylococci may increase their severity, even in the absence of clinical evidence of infection [  9,10  ]. However, allergic sensitivity to staphylococci or micrococci may be responsible at least for secondary dissemination [  11  ].

## Genetics

There may be an indirect link via atopy (see the section on associated diseases above).

## Environmental factors

There  may  be  a  clinically  relevant  underlying  allergic  contact dermatitis in about one-third of patients. In one case series 33% of  patients  were  considered  to  have  clinically  relevant  positive results,  reacting  to  rubber  chemicals,  formaldehyde,  neomycin, chrome and nickel [  12  ]. On being re-contacted by telephone, eight of 13 patients reported improvement in their nummular dermatitis as a result of avoidance of allergens identifi  ed by patch testing [  12  ].

Dry skin due to low environmental humidity is sometimes associated with nummular dermatitis [  13  ], particularly in the elderly [  14  ].  An  association  between  excessive  alcohol  intake  and  nummular dermatitis has been reported [  15  ].

Nummular dermatitis has occurred rarely as a result of sensitivity  to  aloe  [  16  ],  depilating  creams  [  17  ]  and  mercury  [  18  ],  and  in patients taking methyldopa [  19  ]. In addition, oral gold therapy in the form of sodium aurothiomalate and auranofi  n has been associated with nummular dermatitis in a dose-dependent manner, with resolution on discontinuing the drug and recurrence after rechallenge [  20  ].

## Clinical features

## Presentation

The  diagnostic  lesion  of  nummular  dermatitis  is  a  coin-shaped plaque of closely set, thin-walled vesicles on an erythematous base. This arises, quite rapidly, from the confl  uence of tiny papules and papulovesicles. These may occur, in the phase of very acute dissemination, as individual lesions on the trunk or limbs at the same time as localized plaques are being formed. In the acute phase the lesions are dull red, very exudative or crusted and highly pruritic (Figure   39.3  ). They progress towards a less vesicular and more scaly stage, often with central clearing, and peripheral extension, causing ring-shaped or annular lesions. As they fade, they leave dry, scaly patches.

After any period of between 10 days and several months, secondary lesions occur, often in a mirror-image confi  guration on the opposite side of the body. It is very characteristic of this disease that patches which have apparently become dormant may become active again, particularly if treatment is discontinued prematurely.

## Clinical variants

There are a number of variants:

- •   Nummular dermatitis: exudative type.
- •   Nummular dermatitis: dry type.
- •   Nummular dermatitis of the hands.
- •   Exudative discoid and lichenoid chronic dermatosis.

n  'exudative'  nummular dermatitis the skin lesions resemble I the  acute  phase  of  the  more  typical  form  of  the  condition,  with leakage of serous fl  uid and crust formation. This variant usually represents the more severe end of the disease spectrum and may require oral antibiotic treatment.

Dry' nummular dermatitis is an uncommon variant, consisting ' of  multiple,  dry,  scaly,  round  or  oval  discs  on  the  arms  or  legs, but also with scattered microvesicles on an erythematous base on the palms and soles [  21  ]. Itching is minimal, in contrast with other forms of nummular dermatitis, and the condition persists for several years, with fl  uctuation or remission. It is notably resistant to treatment.

Nummular  dermatitis  of  the  hands  affects  the  dorsa  of  the hands or the backs or sides of individual fi  ngers. It often develops as a single plaque, which may occur at the site of a burn or a local chemical or irritant reaction. Secondary lesions may occur on the hands, fi  ngers or forearms, but generalized spread is uncommon. It is a not uncommon form of irritant occupational dermatitis, but may also occur without occupational exposure. An atopic history appears to be more frequent in young women with discoid hand eczema than in other forms of the disease.

Exudative discoid and lichenoid chronic dermatosis [  22  ] has no rigid criteria, but it is a widespread, extremely pruritic eruption, characterized by discoid lesions with 'lichenoid' and exudative  phases,  which  either  coexist  or  alternate  rapidly  with each  other  (Figure    39.4  ).  After  a  chronic  course  of  months  or years the condition ends in spontaneous cure. It occurs predominantly in adult male Jews, usually between the ages of 40 and 60 years. More than 100 cases have been reported [  23  ], but some authors deny its existence as a distinct entity and consider it to be a variant of nummular dermatitis [  24  ]. The scarcity of reports of this entity over the last three decades lends support to this contention.

## Differential diagnosis

When lesions of nummular dermatitis clear in the centre they may simulate tinea infection. If there is any doubt, skin scrapings

should  be  examined  for  the  presence  of  mycelia.  In  psoriasis, the lesions are dry, the scaling is more prominent and the irritation milder. Pityriasis rosea may transiently resemble nummular dermatitis, but usually presents with the history of a herald patch and characteristic oval patches with long axes parallel to the ribs.

Table   39.2 gives the diagnostic features of a number of types of  discoid  lesions  that  should  be  considered  in  the  differential diagnosis.

## Disease course and prognosis

All forms of nummular dermatitis are chronic, with partial remission during which plaques tend to clear in their centres (Table   39.2  ). Relapse may occur at variable intervals and most are worse during the colder months of the year. A review of 325 cases showed that most either cleared within a year or persisted for many years [  25  ].

## nvestigations I

Exogenous contact dermatitis should be suspected if the condition is  unusually  severe  and  persistent  or  if  patches  are  few,  asymmetrical or of unusual confi  guration. Irritants and, occasionally, sensitizers, may provoke this discoid type of response. When the history suggests this, patch tests should be performed. In a series reported from India [  26  ], positive patch tests were detected in 56% of  patients,  of  which  the  commonest  were  to  chromate,  nickel, cobalt or fragrance. A recent Italian study found highest sensitization rates with nickel sulphate (10.2%), potassium dichromate (7.3%) and cobalt chloride (6.1%) [  27  ].

## Management

General considerations such as the avoidance of irritants apply, as with other forms of eczema. Bed rest and removal from a stressful environment can be helpful. Ambient conditions of low humidity should be corrected.

Emollients  and  topical  corticosteroids  are  useful.  In  the  early stages, a potent or very potent steroid may be needed and combination with a topical antiseptic or antibiotic can be considered. Traditionally,  a  range  of  coal  tar  pastes  or  ointments  were  used in the less acute stages, and sometimes a combination of tar and dilute corticosteroid proved useful in long-term management.

A  course of a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic, such as oxytetracycline or clarithromyin, is often helpful in severe exudative cases.

## Asteatotic eczema

## Defi  nition and nomenclature

This is eczema developing in very dry skin, usually in the elderly.

## Synonyms and inclusions

- •  Eczéma craquelé
- •  Winter eczema

## ntroduction and general description I

Asteatotic  eczema  usually  affects  the  legs,  arms  and  hands  of elderly people in the context of dry skin. A characteristic 'crazypaving' pattern is observed on the legs in particular, resulting in the synonym of eczéma craquelé. It may fl  are during winter due to a reduction in humidity associated with central heating. Management centres on the restoration of skin hydration.

## Epidemiology

## Incidence and prevalence

A recent study of elderly Japanese care home residents found an asteatotic eczema prevalence of 16.4% for those undergoing rehabilitation and 41.2% for those in long-term residential care, with a mean age in the two groups of 85 years and 87 years respectively [  1  ].

## Age

Elderly people are predominantly affected and prevalence increases with increasing age.

## Sex

There  is  insuffi  cient  evidence  to  comment  on  whether  gender affects the likelihood of asteatotic eczema.

## Ethnicity

All ethnicities can be affected.

## Associated diseases

Asteatotic eczema may be a presenting sign of myxoedema [  2  ]. It can also be due to zinc defi  ciency [  3  ].

## Pathophysiology

## Predisposing factors

At  present,  the  relevant  factors  in  the  production  of  asteatotic eczema can be considered to be: (i) a naturally 'dry' skin and a lifelong tendency to chapping; (ii) a further reduction in lipid with age, illness, malnutrition or hormonal decline; (iii) increased transpiration relative to the environmental water content; (iv) loss of integrity of the water reservoir of the horny layer; (v) chapping and degreasing (and perhaps cell damage) by industrial or domestic cleansers or solvents; (vi) low environmental humidity and dry, cold winds increasing convection loss; and (vii) repeated minor trauma leading to infl  ammation and further disorganization of the surface aqueous/lipid balance. Percutaneous absorption through the degreased and damaged epidermis is increased, and contact irritants and sensitizers may further damage and irritate the skin.

## Pathology

Although the condition is thought to be due to a decrease in skin surface lipid, the exact pathogenesis of the skin changes is obscure. The amino acid content of the skin is lower in more severe cases [  4  . A decrease in the keratohyaline-derived natural moisturizers ] may also be important [  5  ].

Hyposteatosis occurs in many conditions of maldevelopment, malnutrition  and  atrophy  of  the  skin,  but  does  not  necessarily lead to eczema. The part played by the loss of fl  uid from the skin has  been  underrated  in  the  past.  The  relationship  between  the transpiration rate and the lipid layer has been the subject of many studies [  6  ]. Using excised skin it was shown that removal of these lipids increased water loss by 75 fold, and that this returned to normal when they were restored. The implications for treatment are obvious.

The  histopathological  features  are  those  of  a  mild,  subacute eczema, with a varying amount of dermal infi  ltrate. When vesicular  or  nummular dermatitis supervenes, the changes are more marked, and are as seen in the latter disease.

## Genetics

No specifi  c  genetic  mutations  have  been  documented in the literature to date.

## Environmental factors

A patient will often ascribe the onset to an event or change in life that  is  quite  trivial,  for  example  the  installation  of  central  heating or a particularly cold, dry winter [  7  ]. In industry, years of contact with degreasing agents may be tolerated until, usually in the 50-60-year age group, some small additional hazard precipitates a disabling dermatitis.

Diuretics  sometimes  appear  to  be  an  important  contributory factor in elderly people [  8  ]. Cimetidine has also been reported to cause asteatotic dermatitis [  9  ], as have topical corticosteroids [  10  ].

## Clinical features

## History

rritation in this form of eczema is often intense, and worse with I changes of temperature, particularly on undressing at night.

## Presentation

The  condition  occurs  particularly  on  the  legs,  arms  and  hands. The asteatotic skin is dry and slightly scaly (Figure   39.5  ). The surface of the backs of the hands is marked in a criss-cross fashion. The fi  nger pulps are dry and cracked, producing distorted prints and retaining a prolonged depression after pressure ('parchment pulps').  On  the  legs  the  pattern  of  superfi  cial  markings  is  more marked and deeper ('crazy-paving' pattern or eczéma craquelé). In  some  patients  the  fi  ssures  may  become  haemorrhagic.  The borders  of  this  irregular  reticulation  become  erythematous  and slightly  raised,  and  frank  eczematous  changes  fi  nally  develop. Similarly, on the hands, localized areas become chapped or itchy, and eventually form eczematous patches.

## Clinical variants

Extensive or generalized forms involving the trunk as well as the legs are rare but should raise the suspicion of malignancy. Cases have  been  reported  in  association  with  malignant  lymphoma [  11  ], angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy [  12  ], anaplastic gastric  adenocarcinoma  [  13  ]  and  spheroidal  cell  carcinoma  of  the breast [  14  ].

## Differential diagnosis

Asteatotic eczema has a characteristic appearance thus the differential diagnosis is limited to other forms of eczema.

## Classifi  cation of severity

There are no specifi  c severity classifi  cation systems.

## Complications and co-morbidities

As with all forms of eczema, secondary infection is possible due to a reduction in skin barrier function. Nummular dermatitis can also occur on a background of asteatotic eczema, although the relationship between the two conditions is uncertain.

## Disease course and prognosis

Without  treatment,  the  condition  is  usually  chronic,  relapsing each winter and clearing in the summer, but eventually becoming permanent. Scratching, rubbing or contact irritants and sensitizers cause further eczematous changes or spread; or a more diffuse vesiculosquamous eruption occurs.

## nvestigations I

There  are  no  specifi  c  invesigations  unless  generalized  asteatotic eczema is present.

## Management

The  patient's  immediate  environment may need to be adjusted. Central heating should be humidifi  ed where possible, and abrupt temperature changes should be avoided. Wool is usually poorly tolerated and possibly damaging due to irritation. Baths are best restricted and should not be hot. Bath oils or oatmeal packs may be helpful, although it is important to remember that bath oils are potentially hazardous in the elderly as the bath may be made slippery. Emollients should be used after bathing and during the day. Emollient creams such as those based on lanolin or paraffi  ns are generally  helpful.  Soap  substitutes  should  also  be  prescribed  to reduce irritation from soap.

Weak  topical  corticosteroids  are  often  prescribed,  and  those contained in a urea base (see Chapter   18  ) are very appropriate in this situation as urea encourages hydration. Among the older remedies, ichthammol is of value.

## Dermatitis and eczema of the hands

## Defi  nition and nomenclature

The term hand eczema implies that the dermatitis is largely confined to the hands, with only minor involvement of other areas. If the eczema is widespread and the hands appear to be involved only coincidentally, it is preferable to refer to hand involvement.

## ynonyms and inclusions S

- ·    Hyperkeratotic palmar eczema is also known as 'tylotic eczema'. Pompholyx hand eczema is also known as 'vesicular eczema of palms and soles'. When pompholyx occurs on the palms, it may be called 'cheiropompholyx', and when on the soles, 'podopompholyx'. The term 'dyshidrotic eczema' as an alternative to pompholyx hand eczema has been dropped because no causal relationship with the sweat glands or sweating has been demonstrated.

- •   Contact allergens:
- •   Delayed hypersensitivity (type IV) (e.g. chromium, rubber)
- •   Immediate hypersensitivity (type I) (e.g. seafood)
- •   Ingested allergens (e.g. drugs, possibly nickel, chromium)
- •   Infection (e.g. following bacterial infection of hand wounds)
- ·   Secondary dissemination (e.g. dermatophytide reaction to tinea pedis)

## Endogenous

- •   Idiopathic (e.g. discoid, hyperkeratotic palmar eczema)
- •   Immunological or metabolic defect (e.g. atopic)
- •   Psychosomatic: stress aggravates, but may not be causative
- ·   Dyshidrosis: increased sweating aggravates, but may not be causative

medical  practice  relates  to  hand  eczema,  with  important  issues regarding medical litigation, worker's compensation and disability. A quarter of the patients referred to a specialized contact dermatitis clinic suffered from hand eczema [  2  ].

No single classifi  cation of hand eczema is completely satisfactory. As with eczematous dermatoses in general, classifi  cation is based partly on aetiology and partly on morphology (Boxes 39.2 and 39.3, respectively). Several different morphological forms are seen clinically as fairly consistent entities, but some of these entities can have several different causes. Conversely, a single cause can sometimes produce several different morphological patterns.

Most cases of hand eczema have a multifactorial aetiology. This not only makes treatment diffi  cult, but it can cause considerable problems in medicolegal cases, for example occupational dermatitis in which negligence is alleged against an employer.

## Epidemiology

## Incidence and prevalence

Minor degrees of hand eczema are very common, and virtually everyone suffers from mild dryness and chapping at some time or

another. Approximately 25% of hand eczema patients may never seek medical advice [  3  ]. The perception of whether these changes amount to hand dermatitis can infl  uence the fi  ndings of epidemiological studies [  4  ].

The crude incidence rate of self-reported hand eczema was 5.5 cases per 1000 person-years in a population-based retrospective study from Sweden [  5  ]. A review of studies performed between 1964 and 2007 found a hand eczema point prevalence of about 4%, a one-year prevalence of nearly 10% and a lifetime prevalence of 15% [    ]. 6

In high-risk groups the fi  gures are even higher. In Finland, 44% of 617 hospital personnel engaged in 'wet work', including nurses, cleaners and kitchen staff, had a past or present history of hand eczema and 28% had had at least two attacks [  7  ]. This is confi  rmed by a study demonstrating a signifi  cantly greater risk of hand dermatitis among hairdressers compared with offi  ce workers [  8  ].

## Age

n women, the prevalence of self-reported hand eczema peaks in I young adults and appears to decline with increasing age. This is demonstrated by a Swedish health survey involving 10 950 participants in which the one-year prevalence of hand eczema decreased from 12% in women aged 19-29 years to less than 6% in women aged 70-80 years [  9  ]. In men, there are confl  icting data regarding the effect of age, with some surveys reporting no change and others fi  nding a reduction in frequency with increasing age [    ]. 6

## Sex

Hand eczema is  more  than  twice  as  common  in  women  compared with men. Based on seven studies, the median incidence rate of hand eczema was 9.6 cases/1000 person-years in women and 4.0 in men [    ]. 6

## Ethnicity

Hand eczema is a common problem in all ethnic groups.

## Associated diseases

Hand eczema is more common in people with a previous history of atopic eczema elsewhere [  10  ]. The most common site of atopic eczema in the adult is the hands, and in some patients the hands alone may be involved. The atopic state may fi  rst become apparent with the development of hand eczema in an adolescent or young adult when they are exposed to school, hobby or occupational irritants. There is no specifi  c topographical pattern, although the feet may also be involved [  11,12  ]. The atopic diathesis may also predispose to a discoid pattern of hand eczema in young adults.

## athophysiology P

## Predisposing factors

Atopy, a naturally dry skin, or a superadded contact allergic or irritant dermatitis, are all predisposing factors. The common link is now known to be fi  laggrin gene mutations, as discussed in the Genetics section below.

The role of stress in aggravating hand eczema is diffi  cult to evaluate, and the disease itself is very stressful [  13  ]. Many patients give a  convincing account of exacerbations at times of acute   anxiety,

frustration or grief. The role of hormonal factors is also diffi  cult to assess. Occasionally, there is a history of premenstrual exacerbation, or deterioration during pregnancy.

## Pathology

n  general,  the  differences  between  the  various  forms  of  hand I eczema are clinical rather than histological, but the considerably thickened horny layer and the presence of numerous sweat glands modify the histological features of eczema on the hands.

## Causative organisms

This is not applicable, except for secondary bacterial infection.

## Genetics

T win  studies suggest hereditary factors play a role in the development of hand eczema [  14  ], with the atopic diathesis as the commonest endogenous cause [  15  ]. Loss-of-function mutations of the filaggrin  gene  underpin  the  link  with  atopy  and  are  associated with early onset and persistence of hand eczema in atopic subjects [  16  ].  Carriers of fi  laggrin gene mutations are more likely to develop digital fi  ssures (chapping) than those who do not carry the  mutation  [  17  ].  In  a  3-year  prospective  observational  cohort study of 459 patients with occupational irritant contact dermatitis on the hands, those with atopy and fi  laggrin mutations had more sick leave and a threefold higher rate of job loss compared with controls [  18  ]. Filaggrin gene mutations have also been linked with an increased susceptibility to chronic irritant contact dermatitis in case-control studies [ 19 and chronic hand eczema characterized ] by combined allergic and irritant contact dermatitis [  20  ].

## Environmental factors

Contact irritants are the commonest exogenous cause of hand eczema [  21  ], but contact allergens including chromate, epoxy glues and rubber are also important (see Chapter   128  ). All patterns of hand eczema are possible in contact allergy. Rubber dermatitis usually affects the dorsa of the hands (Figure   39.6  ), but so can contact irritant and atopic eczema [  22  ]. Certain occupations are particularly likely to provoke

hand eczema. The problem of occupational eczema in hairdressers, fish  industry  workers,  farmers,  construction  workers,  dental  and medical personnel, metal workers and caterers has provoked many studies to determine its prevalence and to develop programmes for the prevention of hand dermatitis.

Type 1 allergic reactions to certain proteins may also give rise to hand eczema. In mild cases they provoke a vesicular eczema of the fi  ngers,  particularly  amongst those who prepare seafood. In a Scandinavian study, one-third of restaurant food handlers with hand  dermatitis  had  a  seafood  contact  urticaria  [  23  ].  Amongst health  care  workers,  reactions  to  natural  rubber  latex  protein found in latex gloves are a particular problem. The reactions range from contact urticaria to rhinitis, asthma and anaphylaxis [  24  ].

Oral ingestion of allergens such as nickel, chromium or balsam of Peru has been reported to provoke or aggravate hand eczema in sensitized subjects, although the importance of this phenomenon is controversial [  26  ]. Cold and dry air may play some part [  27  ].

## Clinical features

## History

Particular attention should be given to the patient's occupational and  recreational  activities  because  these  may  indicate  potential  contact  allergies.  Occupational  involvement  is  suggested  by improvement  associated  with  leave  from  work.  Current  handprotection strategies should also be elicited.

Hand eczema often has a severe impact on quality of life, due to pruritus, painful fi  ssuring, loss of dexterity and impairment of social functioning. Median dermatology life quality index (DLQI) scores [  28  ] in patients attending patch test clinics were found to be 7.0 and 8.0 in males and females, respectively [  29  ].

## Presentation

This will be discussed in relation to each clinical variant below.

## Clinical variants

Hyperkeratotic palmar eczema. This condition is a distinct form of hand eczema that is characterized by highly irritable, scaly, fi  ssured, hyperkeratotic patches on the palms and palmar surfaces of the fi  ngers (Figure   39.7  ) [  21  ]. It is common, and 2-5% of all applications for permanent disability pensions in some western European countries are due to hyperkeratotic hand eczema.

ompholyx. P Pompholyx  is  a  form  of  eczema  of  the  palms  and soles in which oedema fl  uid accumulates to form visible vesicles or bullae (Figure   39.8  ). As a result of the thick epidermis in these sites, the blisters tend to become relatively large before they burst. Pompholyx probably accounts for about 5-20% of all cases of hand eczema [  21  ]. There is some debate whether the term pompholyx should be reserved for typical cases in which the attacks resolve and  recur.  Chronic,  recurrent  vesiculation  without  periods  of remission may be termed chronic vesicular dermatitis.

Apron  eczema. This  condition  is  a  type  of  hand  eczema  that involves the proximal palmar aspect of two or more adjacent fi  ngers and the contiguous palmar skin over the   metacarpophalangeal

igure   39.7 F Hyperkeratotic palmar eczema.

joints, thus resembling an apron (Figure   39.9  ) [  3  ]. This pattern of hand eczema may be irritant, allergic or endogenous.

Chronic acral dermatitis. This is a distinctive syndrome affecting patients in middle age. A chronic, intensely pruritic, hyperkeratotic, papulovesicular eczema of the hands and feet, is associated with grossly elevated IgE levels in subjects with no personal or family history of atopy. The condition responds to oral corticosteroids, but the response to topical therapy is poor [  21  ].

Nummular dermatitis. This is also known as discoid eczema (see section on nummular dermatitis earlier in this chapter).

ingertip  eczema. F This  condition  presents  a  characteristic  pattern, involving the palmar surface of the tips of some or all of the fingers. The skin is dry, cracked and sometimes breaks down into painful fi  ssures (Figure   39.10  ). Usually remaining localized, it may occasionally  extend  along  the  palmar  surfaces  of  the  fi  ngers  to merge with palmar eczema. Two patterns may be distinguished. The fi  rst  and  most  common  involves  most  or  all  of  the  fi  ngers, mainly those of the dominant hand, and particularly the thumb and forefi  nger. The condition is usually worse in the winter and generally  improves  on  holiday.  Fingertip  eczema  is  usually  a cumulative  irritant  dermatitis  in  which  degreasing  agents  combine  with  trauma  as  causative  factors;  patch  tests  are  typically negative  or  not  relevant.  The  second  pattern  involves  preferentially the thumb, forefi  nger and third fi  nger of one hand. This is usually occupational and may be either irritant (e.g. in newspaper delivery employees) or allergic (e.g. to colophony in polish). The condition usually involves the dominant hand, but there may be allergy to onions, garlic [  30  ] and other kitchen products held in the non-dominant hand when being cut. In these cases, patch testing (and 20 min contact tests) may be rewarding.

Gut'/slaughterhouse eczema. ' Workers who eviscerate and clean pig  carcasses  are  at  risk  of  developing  vesicular  eczema  which starts in the fi  nger webs and spreads to the sides of the fi  ngers. This is a mild, self-limiting condition, which clears in a week or two, even if the patient remains at work, but it can recur at intervals.  Workers  in  Danish  bacon  factories  call  this  'fat  eczema',

although there is little evidence that it is due to fat, and prick tests to pig fat extracts are negative [  31  ]. The pathogenesis is unknown, but some slaughter workers have developed contact urticaria from exposure to animal blood [  32  ].

Patchy vesiculosquamous eczema. n  a large group of cases, a I mixture of irregular, patchy, vesiculosquamous lesions occur on both hands, usually asymmetrically. In contrast to the lesions of discoid hand eczema, the degree of activity and distribution of the lesions vary. Nail changes are common if the nail folds are affected.

Recurrent focal palmar peeling. The condition is sometimes a mild form of pompholyx; it is also known as desquamation en aires, keratolysis exfoliativa or ringed keratolysis of the palms. During  the  summer  months,  small  areas  of  superfi  cial,  white desquamation  develop  on  the  sides  of  the  fi  ngers  and  on  the palms or on the feet (Figure   39.11  ). They appear abruptly, and expand  before  peeling  off.  There  is  little  or  no  irritation,  and vesicles as such are not seen. The condition is probably not rare, but because it is relatively asymptomatic it often does not reach the  dermatologist.  Some  patients  subsequently  develop  true pompholyx.

![Image](cropped_855ee992-4cb7-415e-aa6f-4ec653ecabb2-with-image-refs_artifacts\image_000014_9a452ffbf6fb8d952235c6f04803e17d255256d6ecfdcf3136f785ed8cd3e913.png)

Ring eczema. This characteristic pattern particularly affects young women, rarely men. The condition usually starts soon after marriage or childbirth. An irritable patch of eczema begins under a ring - usually a broad wedding ring - and typically spreads to involve the adjacent side of the middle fi  nger and the adjacent area of the palm. It may remain confi  ned to these sites, but is occasionally followed by the appearance of discoid patches elsewhere; or a more diffuse vesicular eczema may develop. Despite the clearly defi  ned demarcation of the initial eruption, these patients are not sensitive to gold or copper although nickel, cobalt and even chromium sensitivity are more commonly found on patch testing than might be expected; only rarely can 'white gold' alloys be implicated. Ring dermatitis has been described as the clinical presentation of fragrance sensitization [  33  ]. Transference of the ring to the other hand is often rapidly followed by the appearance of eczema at the new site and, once affected, patients may fi  nd that wearing of the ring for only a few minutes, even without washing, causes irritation. This type of hand eczema is probably due primarily to concentrations of soap and detergent beneath rings (which may tighten on fi  ngers immersed in hot water), but microtrauma, especially friction, may also play a role. Very rarely, radioactive gold in a ring may cause radiation dermatitis that mimics this type of wedding ring eczema [  34  ].

## Differential diagnosis

The diagnosis of hand eczema is usually self-evident, but the distinction from psoriasis can be very diffi  cult and may only become apparent over time with development of psoriasis at other sites. In some cases even biopsy does not allow a clear distinction to be made. In most cases of psoriasis on the hands, however, the silvery nature of the scale, involvement of the knuckles, sharply demarcated 'scalloped' edges to the erythema along the borders of the hands and fi  ngers, and the relative absence of pruritus are helpful pointers. A family history of psoriasis and the presence of nail pits in the absence of nail fold lesions are also suggestive.

Tinea manuum can be missed, particularly when it is extensive (Figure    39.12  )  or  secondarily  infected.  Unilateral  scaling  of  the palm should always suggest a possible Trichophyton infection, and a discoid plaque due to Tricophyton verrucosum is sometimes seen in farmers.

Lichen  planus  (Figure    39.13  )  and  pityriasis  rubra  pilaris  may resemble eczema on the hands, but usually present with typical lesions at other sites.

Pompholyx  eczema  can  resemble  palmoplantar  pustulosis. Clinically, the two conditions are distinguished by the presence of vesicles in the former and sterile pustules that resolve with characteristic brown marks in the latter. A pustular bacteride secondary to bacterial infection elsewhere in the body is a less common differential. Repeated attacks of pompholyx may produce hyperkeratotic lesions that mimic psoriasis vulgaris. Pemphigoid, linear IgA disease and pemphigoid gestationis occasionally present with blisters on the palms that mimic pompholyx.

t  must  be  emphasized that the whole skin should be examI ined  in  any  case  of  hand  eczema  in  which  the  diagnosis  is  in doubt. There may, for example, be evidence of nickel allergy or tinea pedis, or small patches of psoriasis of which the patient is unaware.

## Classifi  cation of severity

A photographic guide for assessing the severity of chronic hand dermatitis has been developed and validated, mainly for use in clinical trial settings [  35  ]. In daily practice, measurement of quality of life using a dermatology-specifi  c index can be used by clinicians to quantify disease severity. UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for alitretinoin for chronic hand eczema require a DLQI score [  29  ] to be measured [ 36 ,37  ].

## Complications and co-morbidities

Secondary bacterial infection of hand eczema may occur, usually associated with a sudden deterioration, pain and/or exudate from

igure   39.13 F ichen planus mimicking hyperkeratotic hand eczema, but the margins L are well demarcated and the lesions on the left wrist are characteristic of lichen planus.

![Image](cropped_855ee992-4cb7-415e-aa6f-4ec653ecabb2-with-image-refs_artifacts\image_000017_2a6608e14a45151f5c7101c32f9a62aaab0e88832342d43d8331dee05652630c.png)

the affected areas. In pompholyx eczema, infection may also be indicated by the new onset of pustules rather than vesicles, usually in association with pain.

## Disease course and prognosis

Unless a responsible allergen can be identifi  ed and removed, the prognosis of hand eczema for an individual is uncertain. Even if a relevant allergen is identifi  ed, it may be diffi  cult to avoid all contact with the hands for allergens such as nickel and fragrance. Atopic hand eczema probably has the worst prognosis of all types of hand eczema [  21  ]. In general, eczema on the dorsa of the hands clears more readily, and is less likely to recur than palmar eczema.

Following  an  acute  attack  of  pompholyx,  about  one-third  of patients experience no further episodes, one-third suffer from recurrent episodes and in the remainder the condition develops into a chronic, possibly hyperkeratotic phase. Those forms of hand eczema that are due in part or wholly to the effects of irritants carry a particularly  poor  prognosis  unless  these  irritants  can  be  completely removed. Patients who have suffered from severe hand eczema will often remain vulnerable to mild irritants for several months after the eczema has apparently cleared. Interdigital dermatitis has been shown to be a potential precursor to more severe hand dermatitis in hairdressers. Recognition of this sign by the patient may allow early intervention to prevent progression of the disease [  38  ].

A  questionnaire  follow-up  answered  by  868  of  1115  persons with hand eczema identifi  ed 15 years previously in a populationbased study found that 44% had experienced hand eczema in the previous year [  39  ]. For about 5%, the hand eczema had resulted in a major change such as long sick leave periods, early retirement or a change of occupation.

## nvestigations I

A circumscribed and asymmetrical area of scaling and vesiculation of the palm or sole should suggest the possibility of dermatophytosis, and scrapings should be examined for fungus. If the erythema is limited to one or two interdigital clefts, or is asymmetrical,  or  involves  the  dorsal  skin  to  any  extent,  the  possibility  of  a  contact  dermatitis  must  be  considered  and  investigated by patch testing. Patch testing should be guided by the patient's occupational and other allergen exposures. If there are immediate symptoms on wearing latex gloves, then type 1 latex hypersensitivity should be excluded with latex prick testing.

## Management

## Chronic hand eczema

Management of chronic hand eczema, defi  ned as persisting for at least 6 weeks, is similar to eczema affecting other skin sites and involves the avoidance of irritants, frequent application of emollients and use of topical corticosteroids when indicated.

Avoidance of irritants is particularly diffi  cult for patients with hand eczema because they are so ubiquitous. Patient education is of paramount importance and this can be reinforced by printed or online advice sheets. Gloves usually provide the best protection against irritants and advice should be given regarding the optimal choice of glove in terms of the material, size and weight depending on the individual's particular needs. Rubber gloves generally give  good  protection  for  housework.  In  patients  with  a  rubber allergy,  polyvinyl  chloride  household  gloves  should  be  worn instead. It should be noted that some allergens, such as acrylates and epoxy resins, can penetrate vinyl or rubber gloves [  40  ]. Gloves that develop holes should be discarded immediately and, if sweating makes the condition worse, it may be helpful to wear cotton gloves beneath the protective ones.

Barrier creams are used in an attempt to prevent hand eczema of occupational origin, however in practice they may not be applied effectively [  41  ], and the debate continues about their actual benefi  t [  42  ]. A recent Cochrane review of interventions such as emollients and barrier creams for preventing occupational irritant hand dermatitis found generally positive results but no statistical signifi  cance was reached [ 43 . ]

Emollients should be applied frequently, and containers should be left at convenient locations at home and at work so that they are readily available. In general, choice of emollient is directed by the patient  to  ensure  maximal  compliance.  Soap  substitutes  should be used in place of soap for all hand washing. Patients should be warned that some topical preparations sold over the counter by pharmacists  as  antipruritics  or  emollients  can  contain  irritants such as alcohol or propylene glycol.

Topical corticosteroids are required for all but the mildest cases of hand eczema. For severe hand eczema, potent or very potent topical corticosteroids may be needed. Painful fi  ssures of the fi  ngertips are a particular therapeutic problem and these can be treated with corticosteroid-impregnated  adhesive  tape,  which  provides  both physical protection and local delivery of topical corticosteroid.

n diffi  cult, unresponsive cases the use of a topical corticosteroid I under occlusion may be considered. The steroid is applied at bedtime, and polythene gloves, sealed at the wrist with sticky tape, are worn overnight. This can be an effective treatment, but it greatly increases the risk of atrophy and secondary bacterial infection, and should be discontinued as soon as the eczema shows satisfactory improvement. After improvement with daily corticosteroid use, the intermittent use of a potent corticosteroid cream can be used safely to prevent relapse [  44  ].

If hand eczema does not respond to topical corticosteroid therapy, the diagnosis should be reviewed, particularly with regard to the possibility of tinea. The patient should be asked again about exposure  to  irritants  or  allergens,  and  the  possibility  of  contact sensitization to medicament bases, preservatives or the corticosteroid itself should be considered, with patch testing if necessary.

Topical calcineurin inhibitors provide a further option for treating hand eczema. In a left/right comparative trial with 16 subjects, topical tacrolimus 0.1% proved similar in effi  cacy to mometasone furoate [  45  ]. The response to tacrolimus was better on the palms than soles.

Tar pastes have been used for chronic unresponsive cases and salicylic acid ointment is also sometimes helpful for hyperkeratosis and persistent scaling [  46  ]. Intradermal injection of triamcinolone (10  mg/mL) into recalcitrant, localized patches of hand eczema may also be benefi  cial [  46  ]. Other treatments include Grenz rays [  47  ] and, for pompholyx eczema, iontophoresis has been used successfully [  48  ].

At  present, the retinoid alitretinoin (9-cis-retinoic acid) is the  only  licensed  systemic  therapy  for  chronic  hand  eczema.  It

interacts with both retinoid X and retinoic acid receptors and has been shown to improve chronic hand eczema in a large placebocontrolled trial with over 1000 subjects [ 49 ].  After 24 weeks of alitretinoin 30 mg daily, 48% of patients were clear or almost clear of their hand eczema, corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of about 4 (95% confi  dence interval 2.63-4.25) [  50  ]. Mucocutaneous adverse effects are less common than for other systemic retinoids and the commonest issue reported was headache, which occurred in one-fi  fth of patients. In the UK, NICE has approved alitretinoin for patients who have severe chronic hand eczema, defi  ned by the physician's global assessment and a DLQI score of 15 or more, and who have failed potent topical corticosteroid therapy [  37  ].

There are only limited randomized controlled trial (RCT) data regarding  the  use  of  other  systemic  agents  for  chronic  hand eczema. A small RCT involving 29 patients with hyperkeratotic hand  eczema  suggested  some  benefi  t  from  acitretin  [  51  ],  however this is unsuitable for women of child-bearing age due to its long half-life and teratogenicity. An RCT of 41 patients compared ciclosporin 3 mg/kg daily with a potent topical corticosteroid and found  no  signifi  cant  difference  between  the  two  groups  [  52  ].  A brief report of an RCT comparing azathioprine 50 mg daily and a very potent topical corticosteroid with the very potent topical corticosteroid alone suggests possible additive benefi  t from low-dose azathioprine [  53  ].

Oral psoralen and UVA (PUVA) phototherapy and UVB therapy have been used to treat chronic hand eczema and limited RCT evidence suggests that oral PUVA may be more effective than UVB [  54  ]. T opical hand PUVA soaks are frequently used in clinical practice  although  there  is  only  limited  published  evidence  for  hand eczema. Case series evidence suggests that hand PUVA soaks are less effective for hyperkeratotic hand eczema [  55  ].

## Acute hand eczema

For hand eczema that presents acutely, it is important to eliminate any precipitant, for example a contact allergen. Emollients should be  applied  copiously  and,  if  the  eruption  involves  exudate  or pompholyx vesicles, then dilute potassium permanganate soaks are helpful. Large bullae may be aspirated using a sterile syringe. Systemic antibiotics will be required if secondary bacterial infection develops and empirical therapy with fl  ucloxacillin to provide cover for staphylococci is generally effective, pending culture and sensitivity results from swabs.

## Dermatitis and eczema of the lower legs

## Defi  nition and nomenclature

Dermatitis and eczema of the lower legs is subclassifi  ed by ICD-11 as  venous  eczema,  stasis  dermatitis  and  allergic  contact  dermatitis.  Lower  limb  venous  eczema  encompasses  the  skin  changes that result from venous hypertension. Stasis dermatitis relates to the skin changes that result from reduced lower leg venous fl  ow.

## ynonyms and inclusions S

- ·   Venous eczema is also known as varicose eczema. Eczema and dermatitis are used interchangeably.

## ntroduction and general description I

Venous  eczema  and  stasis  dermatitis  both  result  from  dysfunctional venous drainage of the lower legs. There is a great deal of overlap between the two skin conditions, which share the same clinical  features,  and  they  are  distinguished  by  the  presence  or absence of venous hypertension. Allergic contact dermatitis of the lower legs is a common complication of both skin conditions.

## pidemiology E

## ncidence and prevalence I

The combined prevalence of venous eczema and venous stasis is estimated to be between 3% and 11% of the population [  1,2  ].

## Age

Venous eczema patients are usually middle-aged or elderly.

## Sex

There  is  an  increased  incidence  in  females,  which  may  be  due to  hormonal  effects  and  the  tendency  for  deep-vein  thrombosis (DVT) to occur during pregnancy.

## Ethnicity

Venous eczema affects all ethnicities.

## Associated diseases

As discussed previously, there is an association between venous eczema and allergic contact dermatitis.

## Pathophysiology

## Predisposing factors

V enous  eczema  is  more  likely  after  a  previous  DVT  and  in  the presence of venous stasis, which is itself linked to obesity, immobility, and previous cellulitis [  2  ].

## Pathology [  3-6  ]

n venous eczema, the oxygen content in the femoral venous blood I of the leg affected by venous hypertension is increased, and the venous blood in such limbs has a faster circulation time than normal [  7,8  ]. These observations could be explained by the development of arteriovenous shunts in the affected areas, but the use of radioactively labelled macroaggregates or microspheres has failed to provide any evidence for such shunts.

An alternative explanation for these fi  ndings has been provided by Browse and Burnand [  4  ], who suggested that the high ambulatory venous pressure within the calf muscle pump is transmitted to  the  capillary  circulation in the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the calf. This distends the local capillary bed and widens the endothelial pores, thus allowing fi  brinogen molecules to escape into the interstitial fl  uid, where they form a fi  brin sheath around the capillaries. This layer of fi  brin presumably forms a pericapillary barrier to the diffusion of oxygen and other nutrients that are essential for the normal vitality of the skin. The hypothesis that pericapillary fi  brin impedes oxygen diffusion has been supported by a study using positron emission tomography [  9  ].

t I has  also  been  suggested  that  cutaneous  infl  ammation  in venous hypertension may result from increased sequestration of white cells in the venules, with a consequent release of proteolytic enzymes and free radicals which produce tissue damage [  5  ]. In normal subjects, white cells are sequestered in the limb when venous pressure is elevated, and in patients with venous insuffi  ciency the effect  is  enhanced,  with  increased  endothelial  contact  and  adhesion of white cells [  10  ]. This effect may be related to an increase in expression of adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on the vascular endothelium in affected skin [  11  ].

## Causative organisms

This  is  not  applicable,  except  in  cases  of  secondary  infection,  in which standard organisms such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are implicated.

## Genetics

No strong genetic links have been identifi  ed to date.

## Clinical features

## History

Venous eczema may develop suddenly or insidiously. It may occur as a late result of DVT.

## Presentation

Venous eczema and stasis dermatitis are both erythematous, scaly and often exudative eruptions usually seen around the ankle and lower  leg  (Figure    39.14  ).  Occasionally,  similar  changes  occur  at other  sites  of  venous  hypertension  such  as  the  pendulous  skin

over  an  obese  abdomen  or  in  association  with  an  ateriovenous fistula in the upper limb [  12  ]. The eczema is often accompanied by other manifestations of venous hypertension, including dilatation  or  varicosity  of  the  superfi  cial  veins,  oedema,  purpura, haemosiderosis and ulceration (Figure   39.15  ), or small patches of white, atrophic, telangiectatic scarring ('atrophie blanche'). These changes, which occur in various combinations, are discussed in more detail in Chapter   103  . Leashes of dilated venules around the dorsum of the foot or ankle are particularly common. There may be a subepidermal vascular proliferation producing purple papules around the ankle, which may resemble Kaposi sarcoma [  13  ].

## Clinical variants

Secondary patches of eczema may develop on the other leg, even when it is not affected by obvious venous insuffi  ciency. Generalized secondary dissemination may occur, and occasionally this can progress to erythroderma.

## Differential diagnosis

Although most cases of eczema of the lower leg are secondary to  venous hypertension or stasis dermatitis, it must be remembered  that  many  other  types  of  eczema  may  affect  this  region, and in many cases there are multiple causative factors. In children or young adults, atopic eczema may manifest as lichenifi  ed patches around the ankle or behind the knees. Allergic contact dermatitis of the lower legs is usually due to topical medicaments (Figure   39.16  ). Patch testing is often indicated. An infected ulcer may  be  complicated  by  infective  eczema  spreading  from  the edge of the ulcer, with response to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Nummular dermatitis is common on the lower leg, usually on the anterior or anterolateral aspect. Asteatotic eczema commonly affects the legs of elderly patients.

Although the exact cause of eczema on the lower legs can be difficult to elucidate, other conditions can usually be readily identified. Psoriasis may present as a single, irritating plaque on the leg, but is usually more scaly and clearly marginated. Hypertrophic lichen planus of the lower leg may occasionally be mistaken for eczema if there are no characteristic lesions elsewhere. Dermatophyte infection may present as diffuse erythema and scaling and may be diffi  cult  to  recognize,  particularly  if  it  has  been  treated with topical steroids. Profuse actinic keratoses may cause red, irri-

table patches on the lower legs in sunny climates. In the late stage of borreliosis, the leg can feel heavy, with thick cyanotic itchy skin that may mimic the changes of venous hypertension [  15  ].

## Classifi  cation of severity

No specifi  c venous eczema or stasis dermatitis severity scores are currently available.

## Complications and co-morbidities

Allergic  contact  dermatitis. Clinically  this  may  present  as  an eczematous eruption with a sharp, linear cut-off matching to the application of a topical therapy, wound dressing, or compression  hosiery. Allergic  contact  dermatitis  is  a  common  complication of venous eczema, possibly because of the large number of  antigen-presenting  cells  in  the  infl  amed  skin  [  14  ]  and  also because of prolonged contact with topical therapies and compression  hosiery.  Allergens  include  topical  antibiotics,  topical  steroids,  preservatives,  fragrances  and  rubber  accelerators. Allergic contact dermatitis of the lower leg is covered in more detail in Chapter   128  .

econdary infection. S This usually presents as a sudden worsening of eczema. If cellulitis ensues, the patient may experience pain and increased skin temperature and swelling of the affected area, as well as malaise and rigors if infection becomes systemic. The mode of antibiotic administration depends on the severity of the infection, ranging from topical antibiotics for mild infection, oral for moderate and intravenous for severe infection.

ipodermatosclerosis. L Chronic venous insuffi  ciency may result in lipodermatosclerosis, described in more detail in Chapter   103  .

Venous  ulceration. There  is  an  association  between  venous eczema and venous ulceration because these are both the result of  venous  hypertension.  Ulcer  healing  is  inhibited  by  both venous  eczema  and  stasis  dermatitis,  in  part  due  to  chronic lower leg swelling.

## Disease course and prognosis

Venous eczema is a chronic condition that undergoes relapses and remissions. Long-term improvement may be provided by effective lower limb compression, if tolerated, or in some cases by varicose vein surgery.

## nvestigations I

Ankle  brachial  pressure  index  (ABPI)  measurement  is  required prior to consideration of compression therapy. An ABPI of more than 0.8 indicates suitability for graduated compression bandages, in the absence of vessel calcifi  cation due to diabetes or atherosclerosis, which can give a falsely high reading (see Chapter   104  ).

## Management

Any  underlying  venous  hypertension  and/or  pedal  oedema should  be  controlled.  Obese  patients  should  be  urged  to  lose weight.  Well-fi  tted  support  stockings  or  fi  rm  bandages  can  be helpful if worn regularly and care is taken to avoid the formation

of a band at the top of the leg. The legs should be elevated as effectively as possible.

Mild topical steroids may be used to relieve irritation, but the use of potent corticosteroids should be limited to short periods of a few days as they may cause cutaneous atrophy and increase the risk of ulceration. Topical tacrolimus has been reported to be effective [  16  ]. Bacterial infection must be treated where appropriate,  but  the  risk  of  sensitization  to  topical  antibiotics  and  antiseptics should be borne in mind, and systemic antibiotics may be preferable. Bacteria cultured from a swab are not necessarily playing a pathogenic role. If trauma is thought to be playing a part,  and  the  patient  cannot  resist  scratching,  a  paste  bandage may be helpful.

## Dermatitis and eczema of the eyelids

## Defi  nition

This is eczema affecting predominantly the eyelids.

## Pathophysiology [  1 , 2 ]

This  is  a  common  clinical  presentation.  Eyelid  involvement  is  a very  common  feature  of  atopic  eczema  (Figure    39.17  )  and  it  is likely that many cases represent mild atopic eczema without other manifestations. Seborrhoeic dermatitis may also underlie the presentation. Contact allergy to various components of eye makeup, nail  varnish,  fragrance,  rubber  [  3  ]  or  ophthalmic  medicaments [  4    are  responsible  for  some  cases. Allergy to nickel in   spectacle ] frames may cause eczema near the lower eyelids. In some cases the cause remains obscure.

## Management

When  the  condition  is  not  amenable  to  removal  of  the  cause, treatment  with  hydrocortisone  cream  is  often  effective.  Topical immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) can also be particularly  useful  in  this  setting,  and  avoid  the  risks  of  inducing atrophy, rosacea or raised intraocular pressure associated with prolonged use of topical corticosteroids.

## ynonyms and inclusions S

- •    Forefoot eczema
- •    Peridigital dermatosis
- •    Dermatitis plantaris sicca
- •    Atopic winter feet

## ntroduction and general description I

The fi  rst record of this condition appeared in 1968, and since then it has been described under a variety of names depending on the authors' beliefs concerning pathogenesis and the possible association  with  atopy.  The  name 'juvenile plantar dermatosis' has the merit of making no presumptions about cause.

## Epidemiology

## Age

It occurs mainly in children aged 3-14 years. Only occasional cases are seen in adults or infants.

## Sex

There is a slight preponderance of male children.

## Associated diseases

An association with atopy has been proposed but the evidence for this is not convincing. In a controlled study, a personal or family history of eczema or other atopic illness was not more common in cases than in controls [  1  ].

## Pathophysiology [  2,3  ]

The histology shows a mild, non-specifi  c eczema. A blockage of sweat ducts can sometimes be identifi  ed.

## Genetics

uvenile plantar dermatosis has been reported in identical twins [  4  ]. J

## Environmental factors [  1,2  , 5-8  ]

It seems likely that changes in fashion, and the resulting changes in the composition of children's socks and shoes, may have been responsible for the emergence of this disease. Waxing and waning fashions for the use of synthetic materials such as nylon and plastics, compared with more porous natural materials such as cotton, wool and leather, may have been responsible. However the exact pathogenesis of the disease remains uncertain [  5  ]. Occasional cases have occurred in children wearing open leather sandals and cotton socks. Many of the affected children are keen on dancing or sports, and this suggests that friction and enhanced sweating may be playing some part.

## Clinical features

The presenting features of juvenile plantar dermatosis are redness and soreness on the plantar surface of the forefoot, which assumes a shiny, 'glazed' and cracked appearance (Figure   39.18  ). The condition is most severe on the ball of the foot and toe pads, and tends to spare the non-weight-bearing instep. The toe clefts are normal and this helps to distinguish the condition from tinea pedis. The symmetry of the lesions is a striking feature. Occasionally, the disease can affect the hands, resulting in sore, shiny, fi  ssured palms or fingertips. This is more likely in atopic subjects [  9  ].

Most cases will clear spontaneously during childhood or adolescence, but the condition may persist into adulthood [ 10 . ]

## nvestigations I

The diagnosis is clinical, although skin scrapings to exclude fungus and patch tests to exclude footwear allergy may be helpful

if  there is any doubt. Consultation with the manufacturer of the shoes may help to identify potential allergens.

## Management

Patients are usually advised to change from non-porous footwear to 100% cotton socks, and leather shoes or sandals, although this strategy may not resolve the problem [  1  ,  8  , 10 1  ]. A variety of topi,1 cal preparations may help, including urea preparations, Lassar's paste, white soft paraffi  n, tar or tacrolimus ointment, but no single preparation is always effective [  2  ,  12-14  ].

## MISCELLANEOUS SPECIFIED ECZEMATOUS DERMATOSES

## nfective dermatitis I

## Defi  nition and nomenclature

nfective  eczema  is  eczema  that  is  caused  by  microorganisms  or I their products, and that by defi  nition clears when the organisms are eradicated (Figure   39.19  ). This should be distinguished from infected eczema in which eczema due to some other cause is complicated by secondary bacterial or viral invasion of the skin (Figure   39.20  ). In

practice, however, the two conditions can coexist, and the distinction may be diffi  cult.

of an eczematous lesion differs quantitatively from that of normal skin [  1  ]  and  the  demonstration  that  organisms  are  present  does not establish that they are modifying the lesion. The distinction between colonization and infection can be very diffi  cult, but the presence of an increased venous C-reactive protein level may offer a useful clue [  2  ].

Nevertheless,  cases  are  seen  occasionally  in  which  bacterial or viral invasion of the skin seems to occur as the primary event and is  followed  by  secondary  eczematization  which  can  spread for  some  centimetres  beyond  the  area  of  obvious  infection.  The patches of eczema that occasionally develop around lesions of molluscum contagiosum provide a good example (Figure   39.21  ). The pearly papules of molluscum are the initiating event and eczema can develop in the surrounding skin some days later, even when the lesions have not been scratched or traumatized. The eczema generally clears when the molluscum lesions subside. Similarly, one occasionally sees eczematous skin around infected wounds, this clears with antibiotic treatment alone.

## Pathophysiology

The  mechanism  by  which  microorganisms  cause  eczema  is  not understood. Bacterial antigens can promote a cytotoxic reaction in the skin, but this is perhaps more likely to aggravate or perpetuate than to initiate the eczematous process [  3-6  ]. Bacterial superantigens such as staphylococcal protein A and enterotoxin B [  7  ] may be

profound immune stimulants and may aggravate atopic eczema (see Chapter   41  ). Bacterial antigens may play this role in a variety of syndromes, including nummular dermatitis, and not merely in infective  dermatitis.  Cultured  staphylococci  applied  topically  to human skin can also provoke an eczematous delayed hypersensitivity reaction [  7,8  ].

The  possibility  that  bacterial  antigens  from  systemic  foci  of infection may cause eczema has not been fully established. It does seem to be accepted, however, that eczematous reactions can occur as an allergic reaction to a fungal infection elsewhere in the skin (see the dermatophytide section later in this chapter).

## Pathology

The histological picture of infective eczema is in general that of subacute or chronic eczema, in which spongiosis is combined with acanthosis, hyperkeratosis and patchy parakeratosis. The dermis shows infl  ammatory changes, with polymorphonuclear and  lymphocytic  infi  ltration  that  invades  the  epidermis  to  a variable extent. In some stages, subcorneal pustulation may be conspicuous.

## Clinical features

As  mentioned  earlier,  the  distinction  between  infective  and infected eczema can be diffi  cult.

nfected  eczema. I nfected  eczema  shows  erythema,  exudation I and  crusting.  The  exudation  may  be  profuse,  generating  crusting, or slight, with the accumulation of layers of somewhat greasy, moist scale, beneath which the surface is raw and red. The margin is characteristically sharply defi  ned, and the horny layer is often split to form an encircling collarette. There may be small pustules in the advancing edge and, where a fl  exure is involved, it is often the site of a deep and persistent fi  ssure.

nfective eczema. I Infective eczema usually presents as an area of advancing erythema, sometimes with microvesicles. It is seen predominantly around discharging wounds or ulcers, or moist skin lesions of other types. Infective dermatitis is relatively common in patients with venous leg ulcers, but care must be taken to distinguish it from contact dermatitis due to the application of topical medicaments.

Tinea  pedis  may  also  become  eczematous  due  to  the  overgrowth  of  Gram-negative  organisms  [  9  ].  Infective  dermatitis may also complicate chronic threadworm infestation, pediculosis or scabies. It is not always clear how much of the eczematous change is due to: repeated scratching; secondary impetigo; or a direct response to the infestation.

## Clinical variants

Infective  dermatitis  of  the  forefeet  is  a  distinctive  pattern  of eczema that mainly affects the interdigital spaces on the dorsum of the medial toes. Staphylococci or streptococci can be cultured, and the  lesions  respond  to  antiseptic  or  antibiotic  therapy  [  10  ].  This condition seems to occur particularly in patients with poor standards of hygiene, and is predisposed by hyperhidrosis and heavy footwear. In children, the condition must be distinguished from juvenile plantar dermatosis.

## Management

Factors  predisposing  to  infection  should  be  sought,  and  eliminated  when  possible.  Although  topical  antibacterial  agents  are effective  in  mild  forms  of  infective  eczema  due  to  bacteria,  systemic antibiotics may be needed. In acute exudative lesions, potassium permanganate soaks are helpful for the fi  rst 2 or 3 days, in combination with a systemic antibiotic.

## nfective dermatitis of children I associated with human T-cell leukaemia virus 1 infection

## ynonyms and inclusions S

- •   Infective dermatitis of Jamaican children

Sweet, in 1966 [  1  ], used the term infective dermatitis to describe a pattern of dermatitis observed in Jamaican children. Subsequently, Walshe documented the clinical features in 25 Jamaican children [  2  . They included severe, exudative eczema with crusting involv-] ing the scalp, eyelid margins, perinasal skin, retroauricular areas, axillae and groins. There was a generalized, fi  ne papular rash, a chronic  nasal  discharge  and  positive  cultures  for Staphylococcus aureus or β -haemolytic  streptococci  from  the  nose  and/or  skin. The rash responded to oral antibiotic therapy, but relapsed on its cessation.

LaGrenade et al. in 1990 [  3  ], found human T-cell leukaemia virus , 1 (HTLV-1) infection in all of 14 children with this pattern of dermatitis. A later case report identifi  ed one of the children originally described by Sweet and Walshe who, 17 years later, had developed adult T-cell leukaemia [  4  ]. Some of these children may also go on to develop tropical spastic paraparesis [  5  ]. This pattern of dermatitis may be an important early marker of HTLV-1 infection [  6  ].

## ost-traumatic eczema P

It  is rare for eczematous dermatoses to demonstrate the Koebner (isomorphic) phenomenon. However, this may occasionally occur, and eczema may also develop at sites of trauma in individuals

who have no past history of eczematous dermatosis. Eczema can also occur in burn scars [  1  ].

There have been several case reports of dermatitis occurring in the saphenous vein graft donor site for coronary artery bypass surgery [  2,3  ]. The rash comprises reddish brown, slightly crusted and scaly  patches,  with  occasional  papulovesicles.  Histology  shows subacute spongiotic dermatitis. The condition responds to topical corticosteroids, but tends to relapse when the treatment is stopped. Initially, postoperative venous stasis was suggested as the cause. Subsequently, two cases have been reported associated with sensory  neuropathy in the distribution of the saphenous nerve [  4  ]. The dermatitis was located in the same area. Otherwise, the cases were identical to those previously reported. The dermatitis and the sensory neuropathy resolved in tandem over a 2-year period.

## ityriasis alba P

## Defi  nition

This is a pattern of dermatitis in which hypopigmentation is the most  conspicuous  feature.  Some  erythema  and  scaling  usually precede the development of hypopigmentation but these are often relatively mild.

## Epidemiology

## Age

Pityriasis alba occurs predominantly in children between the ages of 3 and 16 years.

## Sex

The sexes are equally susceptible.

## Associated diseases

Pityriasis alba is often a manifestation of atopic eczema but it is not confi  ned to atopic individuals.

## Pathophysiology

The histological changes are unimpressive - acanthosis and mild spongiosis, with moderate hyperkeratosis and patchy parakeratosis. There may be follicular plugging, spongiosis and sebaceous gland  atrophy  [  1-4  ].  On  electron  microscopy  there  are  reduced numbers of active melanocytes and a decrease in the number and size  of  melanosomes  in  affected  skin  [  3  ].  Although  pigment  is reduced, melanocyte numbers are not and may even be increased relative to healthy skin [  5  ].

## Clinical features [  2 ,5-7  ]

The  individual  lesion  is  a  rounded,  oval  or  irregular  hypopigmented patch that is usually not well marginated. Lesions are often slightly erythematous and have fi  ne scaling. Initially, the erythema may be conspicuous and there may even be minimal serous crusting. Later, the erythema subsides completely and, at the stage at which the lesions are commonly seen by a physician, they show only persistent fi  ne scaling and hypopigmentation. It is this that usually induces the patient to seek advice. The hypopigmentation

is most conspicuous in pigmented skin, and in lighter skins may become more evident after sun tanning (Figure   39.22  ).

There  are  usually  several  patches  ranging  from  0.5  to  2  cm in  diameter,  but  they  may  be  larger,  especially  on  the  trunk.  In children the lesions are often confi  ned to the face, and are most common on the cheeks and around the mouth and chin. In 20% of affected children the neck, arms and shoulders are involved as well as the face. Less commonly the face is spared and there are scattered lesions on the trunk and limbs.

## Differential diagnosis

The age incidence, fi  ne scaling and distribution of the lesions usually suggest the diagnosis. Conspicuous hypopigmentation may lead  to  a  misdiagnosis  of  vitiligo.  Naevus  depigmentosus  most commonly presents at birth or before 3 years of age and most often causes single, well-marginated lesions on the trunk [  8  ]. However, this condition may be diffi  cult to distinguish from pityriasis alba when it occurs on the face and in cases of later onset. Nummular dermatitis in an atopic child is intensely pruritic, and the lesions are  larger  and  more  oedematous.  In  older  children  and  adults, early trunk lesions may be mistaken for psoriasis but the distribution and the relatively mild scaling should exclude this diagnosis. Mycosis fungoides, although relatively rare, may present with lesions clinically resembling pityriasis alba [  9  ]. This condition may also be diffi  cult to distinguish histologically and so follow up and repeated biopsies are sometimes required.

## Disease course and prognosis

The  course  is  extremely  variable.  Most  cases  persist  for  some months, and some may still show hypopigmentation for a year or more after all scaling subsides. Recurrent crops of new lesions may develop at intervals. The average duration of the common facial form in childhood is a year or more.

## Management

Response to treatment is often disappointing, mainly because the pigmentation  takes  a  long  time  to  recover.  The  scaling  may  be reduced by a bland emollient cream, and for chronic lesions on the trunk a mild tar paste may be helpful. Mild topical corticosteroids are helpful if infl  ammation persists. Topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are effective in facial atopic eczema and seem likely to prove helpful, if required, in pityriasis alba [  10  ].

## ntroduction and general description I

This  condition  was  formerly  included  with  various  potentially prelymphomatous  eruptions  under  the  general  term  of  'parapsoriasis' [  1-3  ].  The  term chronic superfi  cial scaly dermatitis was introduced by Calnan and Meara [  4  ]  to  distinguish  a  subgroup of  patients  who  did  not  progress  to  frank  lymphoma,  and  the features that they used to distinguish this subgroup are shown in Table   39.3  . The nomenclature has been discussed in detail by Lambert and Everett [  2  ].

The condition is clinically benign by defi  nition [  4  ]. However, in some cases clonality of the lymphocytic infi  ltrate can be demonstrated [  5  ],  a  feature suggesting that this may be regarded as an abortive form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [  6  ]. Ackerman has taken this argument further and expressed the view that even an abortive T-cell lymphoma is still a T-cell lymphoma, so this condition is a clinical presentation of mycosis fungoides [  7  ].

## Age

n most cases the onset is in middle life. I

## Sex

t is much commoner in men than in women. I

## Ethnicity

The  disease  occurs  in  all  races,  although  it  is  probably  rare  in people with darker skin types.

## athophysiology P

The aetiology of the condition is unknown.

## Pathology

The histology is not characteristic. It usually shows the changes of a very mild eczematous eruption, consisting of patchy parakeratosis, mild spongiosis and a slight, mainly perivascular, infi  ltrate in the dermis, chiefl  y composed of lymphocytes [  3  ].

## Clinical features

The  disease  begins  insidiously  with  one  or  more  erythematous, slightly  scaly  patches.  The  legs,  trunk  and  arms  are  most  often affected (Figure   39.23  ). It seldom involves the face, palms or soles.

The patches are generally round or oval, but fi  nger-like processes are also common, especially on the trunk, giving rise to the alternative name 'digitate dermatosis'. The patches are usually about 2.5 cm across, although much larger areas occur at times, especially on the legs. The colour is pink, brown or slightly yellow. The individual patches are often slightly wrinkled and appear like cigarette paper. Symptoms are usually minimal, but some itching may occur.

## Differential diagnosis

The  main  differentials  are  nummular  dermatitis,  eczematides, poikiloderma in its early phase, and the early stages of the classic (Alibert) form of mycosis fungoides (see Table   39.3 and Chapter    140  ).  The  history ,  clinical  appearance,  response  to  treatment and  histology  will  usually  establish  the  diagnosis.  Some  cases originally diagnosed as chronic superfi  cial scaly dermatitis later develop reticulate pigmentation or atrophy, and these cases may then need to be reclassifi  ed as prelymphomatous poikiloderma.

## Disease course and prognosis

The patches are more prominent in winter than in summer, and may clear temporarily with natural or artifi  cial sunlight. They will also clear for a time with suitable topical medications but recur in the same, or adjacent, areas when treatment is stopped. After extending they then usually remain static and, with minor fl  uctuations, persist throughout life. In a few patients the condition clears permanently.

## Management

Only  symptomatic  treatment  is  required  to  allay  irritation.  Mild steroid ointments are generally benefi  cial. Natural sunlight,   narrowband  UVB  and  PUVA  can  be  helpful  when  required,  but  relapse often occurs soon. Narrow-band UVB may also be effective in inducing remission, which can last from a few weeks to many months [  8  ].

## Dermatophytide

## Defi  nition

This is a reaction, at a remote site, to a dermatophyte infection [  1-3  ].

## ntroduction and general description I

This diagnosis should be suspected when the presence of a dermatophyte infection has been established and no fungus can be demonstrated  in  the  dermatophytide  lesions.  The  diagnosis  is supported further by clearing of the dermatophytide after the dermatophyte has been eradicated. A dermatophytide is thus a secondary, distant, aseptic skin lesion. The terminology implies analogy to  the  cutaneous  tuberculides  associated  with  tuberculosis  [  1  ], although the pathomechanisms involved may be different.

## Epidemiology

## ncidence and prevalence I

One study indicated that this condition is rare, as only 10 cases were confi  rmed in 1500 dermatophyte infections [  2  ]. Others have suggested  that  dermatophytide  may  be  more  common.  In  one retrospective  review  of  cases  of  dermatophytide,  37  cases  were seen in a dermatology department in a 2-year period [  4  ].

## Clinical features

Various  clinical  patterns  of  dermatophytide  can  occur.  On  the hands, eczematous vesicles may occur symmetrically on the sides of the fi  ngers, usually as a reaction to tinea pedis. An eczematous dermatophytide  can  also  mimic  pityriasis  rosea  [  1  ].  Other  dermatophytides have been described, often as single case reports, including  erysipelas-like  dermatitis,  erythema  nodosum,  erythema  annulare  centrifugum,  urticaria  and  erythroderma.  A dermatophytide is probably more likely to develop with infl  ammatory dermatophytes, such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes of the zoophilic type [  2  ]. Treatment of the dermatophyte leads to resolution of the secondary rash [  4  ]. A similar allergic reaction to a yeast infection may be termed a candidide (levuride). In this case the eczematous reaction may be localized to the hands or groin [  1  ].

A  dermatophytide  can  be  mimicked  by  bacterial  infection.  In one  study, Staphylococcus  aureus and β -haemolytic  streptococci were commonly isolated from lesions that were thought clinically to be examples of a dermatophytide [  2  ].

Meyerson  [  1  ] described  two  patients  with  multiple,  pruritic, papulosquamous  lesions  surrounding  melanocytic  naevi  (Figure   39.24  ). More than 20 similar cases have since been described [  2-4  ], mainly in young adults. Histology shows a benign naevus surrounded by a dermal lymphocytic and eosinophilic infi  ltrate, with overlying acanthosis, spongiosis and parakeratosis. One case developed during treatment with interferon α -2b in a patient with dysplastic  naevus  syndrome  and  Behçet  disease  [  5  ].

It differs from Sutton halo depigmentation,  although the two conditions have been reported to coexist in the same patient and in one case progression to Sutton naevus occurred  [  6  ].  Similar  changes  are  not  infrequently  seen  around seborrhoeic keratoses [  7  ] and other elevated skin lesions [  8  ] and are termed the Meyerson phenomenon.

## OTHER RELATED DERMATOSES

Lichen simplex is an eczematous dermatosis characterized by a small number of heavily lichenifi  ed plaques or, very often, a single lesion.

## Synonyms and inclusions

## ntroduction and general description I

Lichenifi  cation is a change in appearance and texture of the skin associated  particularly  with  pruritic  dermatoses.  Mild  or  early lichenifi  cation  presents  as  a  rather  subtle  coarsening  of  the  skin surface markings on a background of dry and usually erythematous skin. As the condition progresses, the skin becomes markedly thickened and hyperkeratotic (Figure   39.25  ). Lichenifi  cation may

occur spontaneously, when it is known as lichen simplex, or may occur  as  a  secondary  consequence  of  eczema  and  other  infl  ammatory dermatoses.

## pidemiology E

## Age

Lichen  simplex  is  uncommon  in  childhood.  The  peak  incidence is between 30 and 50 years of age, but it is seen at any age from adolescence onwards. Secondary lichenifi  cation of atopic eczema can occur in any age group and broadly mirrors the prevalence of atopic eczema in the particular age group.

## Sex

Women are affected by lichen simplex more often than men.

## Ethnicity

There is no conclusive evidence of a link with particular ethnicities.

## Associated diseases

A  dermatomal  pattern  of  lichen  simplex  chronicus  has  been described  as  the  initial  presentation  of  an  intramedullary  neoplasm with syringomyelia [  1  ].

## athophysiology P

## Predisposing factors

Patients with lichen simplex are more readily conditioned to scratch following an itch stimulus than are control subjects [  2  ]. Lichenifi  cation frequently occurs as a manifestation of atopic eczema [  3  ] but is not universally present and lichen simplex occurs in many individuals who show no stigmata of atopy. In the predisposed subject, emotional tensions play an important role in favouring the development of lichen simplex and ensuring its perpetuation [  4  ].

## Pathology [  5,6  ]

The  histological  changes  of  lichen  simplex  vary  with  site  and duration. Acanthosis and variable degrees of hyperkeratosis are usually  observed.  The  rete  ridges  are  lengthened.  Spongiosis  is

sometimes present, and small areas of parakeratosis are occasionally seen. There is hyperplasia of all components of the epidermis [  7  . The labelling index has been shown autoradiographically to be ] over 25%, but the transit time is longer than in psoriasis [  8  ].

The  dermis  contains  a  chronic  infl  ammatory  infi  ltrate,  and  in very chronic lesions there may be some fi  brosis. Silver impregnation  techniques  show  proliferation  of  the  Schwann  cells,  which may make up an appreciable proportion of the cellular infi  ltrate.

In  very  chronic  lesions,  especially  in  giant  lichenifi  cation,  the acanthosis and hyperkeratosis are gross, and the rete ridges are irregularly but strikingly elongated and widened.

## Genetics

There  are  no  specifi  c  genetic  links  reported  for  lichen  simplex. Lichenifi  ed atopic eczema is linked with fi  laggrin gene mutations.

## Environmental factors

Lichenifi  cation can arise as a result of allergic contact dermatitis. Lichen simplex has been linked in a case series to allergic contact dermatitis to hair dye [  9  ].

## Clinical features

## History

n all forms of lichenifi  cation, pruritus is a prominent symptom, I and is often out of proportion to the extent of the objective changes. It may develop in paroxysms of great intensity. Scratching tends to give initial satisfaction, but is then continued until the skin is sore.

## Presentation

n lichen simplex, single and multiple sites are involved with about I equal frequency. Almost any area may be affected, but the commonest sites are those that are conveniently reached. The usual sites are the nape of the neck, lower legs (Figure   39.26  a) and ankles (Figure   39.26  b), sides of the neck, scalp, upper thighs, vulva, pubis or  scrotum,  and  extensor  forearms.  In  lichenifi  ed  eczema  and secondary lichenifi  cation, the sites are those affected by the primary dermatosis, for example limb fl  exural sites in atopic eczema.

During  the  early  stages  of  lichen  simplex,  the  skin  is  erythematous and slightly oedematous, and normal skin markings are exaggerated. The erythema and oedema subside and the central area becomes scaly and thickened and sometimes pigmented. Surrounding this central plaque is a zone of lichenoid papules and beyond this an indefi  nite zone of slight thickening and pigmentation merging with normal skin. These features may be greatly modifi  ed by the site and duration of the lesion. In mild cases, follicular eczematous papules may be seen, particularly on the forearms and elbow regions of children (Figure   39.27  ).

## Clinical variants

Lichen simplex of the nape of the neck (lichen nuchae) is usually confi  ned  to  women.  The  plaque  may  be  limited  to  a  small  area around the midline of the nape or may extend some distance into the scalp and over the neck. Scaling is often profuse and psoriasiform, and episodes of secondary infection are frequent. The fold behind the ear may also be involved. Scaling, crusting and fi  ssuring  are  more  evident  than  the  usual  changes  of  lichenifi  cation.

Other regions of the scalp are less often affected. The presenting manifestation is an area of scaling, with twisted, broken hairs. The epidermal thickening may be great enough to form a nodule.

f lichenifi  cation occurs at sites where the subcutaneous tissues I are lax and excoriation continues for many years, solid tumourlike plaques may be formed, with a warty, cribriform surface. This variant is known as giant lichenifi  cation of Pautrier [  10  ] and occurs mainly in the genito-crural region.

The descriptive term pebbly lichenifi  cation has been applied to a distinctive clinical variant, consisting of discrete, smooth nodules, seen occasionally in atopic and seborrhoeic subjects, and in photodermatitis. Clinically it may simulate lichen planus.

## Differential diagnosis

The morphological diagnosis of lichenifi  cation is usually characteristic. However, lichen planus, lichen amyloidosus and psoriasis are differential diagnoses that may be elicited by checking other anatomical sites. Sometimes, however, no conclusive diagnosis is possible on either clinical or histological grounds. A patient with psoriasis may develop lichen simplex that combines the histological features of both conditions.

Once  the  diagnosis  of  lichenifi  cation  has  been  established  its causation  must  be  carefully  investigated.  Secondary  lichenifi  cation complicates persistent skin lesions of many types. It occurs on the lower leg in the presence of venous insuffi  ciency, in atopic eczema,  in  asteatotic  eczema,  in  low-grade  chronic  contact  dermatitis and in some chronic infections with Trichophyton rubrum . Symmetrical lesions may suggest secondary lichenifi  cation from a contact dermatitis.

## Complications and co-morbidities

An  association  has  been  reported  between  lichen  simplex  and depression and dissociative experiences [  11  ].

## Disease course and prognosis

![Image](cropped_855ee992-4cb7-415e-aa6f-4ec653ecabb2-with-image-refs_artifacts\image_000033_51b9439c2d7e99abe0ff588a8d773825eef8fb90d98f364a4c36ac273b4ccfc7.png)

Lichen simplex tends to follow a chronic course unless the itchscratch cycle can be broken.

## nvestigations I

Skin  scrapings  for  mycological  investigation  may  be  indicated. Suspicion of allergic contact dermatitis should be investigated by patch testing.

## Management

A careful psychological history should be taken to elucidate any underlying problems. The nature of lichen simplex and the need to  break  the  scratching  habit  must  be  explained.  Sedative  antihistamines  may  be  helpful  and  antibiotics  may  be  necessary  if secondary infection is present. A potent or very potent topical corticosteroid can be very helpful in some cases, but seems to have no effect in others.

On an arm or leg it is useful to apply an occlusive zinc paste bandage, if tolerated, which prevents scratching and improves skin hydration. Self-adhesive, steroid-impregnated tape (e.g. Haelan® tape) can often be effective for localized lesions. Alternatively, a potent steroid ointment under polythene occlusion, for short periods, may also be considered. Modest improvement has also been shown with 5% doxepin cream [  12  ].

For solitary, circumscribed, chronic lesions, dermal infi  ltration with triamcinolone (10 mg/mL) can be effective.

Response has also been reported to capsaicin cream [  13  ].

## ntroduction and general description I

Erythroderma is included in this chapter because eczema is the commonest  underlying  cause.  Erythroderma  may  be  the  initial presentation of eczema in an individual or, more commonly, arises in the context of longstanding eczema.

## pidemiology E

## ncidence and prevalence I

A survey of dermatologists from the Netherlands estimated the annual incidence at 0.9 per 100 000 population [  1  ].

## Age and sex

In a case series of 97 patients from Iran, the mean age at presentation was 46 years [  2  ]. The male to female ratio was 1.85 : 1.

## Ethnicity

There have been no specifi  c ethnic variations reported.

## Associated diseases

This will vary depending on the underlying cause of the erythroderma.

## Pathophysiology

## Predisposing factors [  3-7  ]

The main causes of erythroderma in adults are listed in Table   39.4 and are discussed below. The fi  gures vary somewhat with the age of  the  population,  and  are  based  on  several  published  studies. In younger people, for example military personnel, there will be a  larger  proportion  due  to  drug  allergies  [  7  ].  Drugs  commonly causing erythroderma are listed in Chapter   119  . In some communities, the incidence of erythroderma may be higher because of self-medication and use of herbal remedies such as St John's wort [  9  . The causes of erythroderma in the newborn are considered in ] Chapter   116  .

Other  rare  causes  of  erythroderma  include  sarcoidosis  [  10  ], Hailey-Hailey  disease  [  11  ],  pemphigoid  [  12  ],  toxic  shock  syndrome [  13  ], lupus erythematosus [  14  ], angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy [  15  ] and dermatomyositis [  16  ]. Graft-versus-host disease may progress to erythroderma in some cases. A related disorder  was  reported  in  Japan,  where  cases  of  fatal  erythroderma occurred following major surgery. It was suggested that these cases were examples of post-transfusion graft-versus-host disease [  17  ].

Erythroderma has occasionally been reported with seroconversion  following  HIV  infection  [  18  ].  In  established AIDS,  erythroderma may arise from a variety of causes including seborrhoeic dermatitis,  lymphoma  or  an  unknown  cause  [  19  ].  However,  it should be noted that CD4+ T lymphocytopenia has been associated with erythroderma in the absence of HIV infection [  20  ].

## Pathology

Histopathology can help identify the cause of erythroderma in up  to  50%  of  cases,  particularly  if  multiple  skin  biopsies  are examined  [  21  ].  The  histological  appearances  vary  depending upon  the  severity  and  duration  of  the  infl  ammatory  process.

In the acute stage, spongiosis and parakeratosis are prominent, and a non-specifi  c infl  ammatory infi  ltrate permeates a grossly oedematous dermis to a variable depth. In the chronic stage, acanthosis  and  elongation  of  the  rete  ridges  become  more prominent.

n  erythroderma due to lymphoma the infi  ltrate may become I increasingly pleomorphic and eventually acquire specifi  c diagnostic features such as a band-like lymphoid infi  ltrate at the   dermalepidermal junction, with atypical cerebriform mononuclear cells  and  Pautrier  microabscesses  [  22  ].  In  other  cases,  however, it  remains  non-specifi  c  throughout  its  course,  and  the  distinction can be diffi  cult. Patients with Sézary syndrome often show some features of chronic dermatitis and benign erythroderma may occasionally show some features suggestive of lymphoma.   Immunophenotyping of the lymphoid infi  ltrate may not solve the problem as it generally shows features of mature T cells in both benign and malignant erythroderma [  23  ].

n psoriasis, papillomatosis and clubbing of the papillary zones I may be seen, and in pemphigus foliaceus, superfi  cial acantholysis will be present. In ichthyosiform erythroderma and pityriasis rubra pilaris, repeated biopsies from carefully selected sites may reveal their characteristic features.

## Genetics

This will depend on the underlying condition.

## Clinical features

## History and presentation

Erythroderma developing in primary eczema or associated with a  lymphoma  is  often  of  sudden  onset.  Patchy  erythema,  which rapidly generalizes, may be accompanied by fever, shivering and malaise. Hypothermia may develop.

The erythema extends rapidly, and may be universal in 12-48 h. Scaling  appears  after  2-6  days,  often  fi  rst  in  the  fl  exures,  but  it varies greatly in degree and character from case to case. The scales may be large or fi  ne and bran-like. At this stage the skin is bright red,  hot  and  dry,  and  palpably  thickened.  The  intensity  of  the erythema may fl  uctuate over periods of a few days or even a few hours. Irritation is sometimes severe, but a sensation of tightness is more characteristic. Many patients complain of feeling cold, especially when the erythema is increasing.

When the erythroderma has been present for some weeks, the scalp  and  body  hair  may  be  shed  and  the  nails  become  ridged and thickened and they may also be shed. The periorbital skin is infl  amed and oedematous, resulting in ectropion, with consequent epiphora. In very chronic cases there may be pigmentary disturbances, especially in black people, in whom patchy or widespread loss of pigment is often seen.

The degree of enlargement of the lymph nodes in the absence of an underlying malignant lymphoma is variable. They are usually slightly or moderately enlarged and of rubbery consistency, but in some cases the enlargement may be gross. It is important that this dermatopathic lymphadenopathy is not mistaken for lymphoma. In diffi  cult  cases,  lymph node biopsy may be advisable, but the pathologist  must be told that the patient is  erythrodermic for a reliable histological interpretation to be made.

The general picture is modifi  ed according to the nature of any underlying  disease  and  the  patient's  age  and  general  physical condition.

## Clinical variants

Clinical variants are considered in terms of the underlying cause of the erythroderma. Papuloerythroderma of Ofuji is also discussed as a distinct clinical variant.

Eczematous  dermatoses. Generalization  of  an  eczema  occurs most frequently in the sixth and seventh decades when venous eczema is  a  common  precedent.  However,  atopic  erythroderma may occur at any age. Exacerbation of existing lesions usually precedes the generalization, which follows the usual pattern. Pruritus is often intense. Some elderly patients have increased serum IgE and lactic dehydrogenase levels, with eosinophilia [  24  ].

Psoriasis. n  erythrodermic  psoriasis  (Figure    39.28  )  the  clinical I picture may be highly desquamative but when the erythroderma is fully developed the specifi  c features of psoriasis are often lost. In  some  cases,  crops  of  miliary  pustules  may  develop  at  intervals, and transition to generalized pustular psoriasis may occur, especially  in  cases  treated  with  potent  topical  corticosteroids  or systemic  steroids  [  25  ].  Emotional  stress,  intercurrent  illness  and phototherapy overdosage may also precipitate erythroderma.

ymphoma,  leukaemia  and  other  malignancy. L Cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma is the commonest malignancy to cause erythroderma (Figure 9.29  ), 3 followed by Hodgkin disease. Non-Hodgkin

ymphoma, leukaemias and myelodysplasia have also been reported l as  causes. Association  with  other  internal  malignancies  has  been observed less often [  6  ].

The clinical picture follows the pattern already described, but the accentuation of certain features should arouse suspicion that a  lymphoma  is  associated,  even  if  repeated  investigations  over a period of months fail to provide convincing confi  rmatory evidence. In many such cases the underlying disease will eventually be  detected.  Pruritus  is  often  very  severe.  The  erythroderma  is universal, and infi  ltration  of  the  skin  may  be  so  severe  that  the patient's features are deformed. Rubbing and scratching may produce secondary lichenifi  cation. Enlargement of the lymph nodes may be considerable, even if histologically they are not infi  ltrated by the lymphoma.

A biopsy of involved skin may show only non-specifi  c features initially, and may need to be repeated several times before infi  ltration  with  atypical  lymphocytes  becomes  evident. A  skin  biopsy for  the  analysis  of  T-cell  receptor  gene  rearrangement,  to  determine whether clonality is present in the infi  ltrate, may be helpful [  26,27  ]. Lymph node biopsy may be diagnostic of lymphoma but often shows only the features of dermatopathic lymphadenopathy. There may be hepatosplenomegaly. A differential white blood cell count should be performed and the blood examined for abnormal cells.  Eosinophilia  may  suggest  Hodgkin  disease. Atypical  lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei (Sézary cells) are often observed in erythroderma regardless of cause. When they constitute more than  20%  of  the  circulating  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells they  become  diagnostic  of  the  leukaemic  variant  of  cutaneous T-cell lymphoma known as Sézary syndrome. Large Sézary cells (15-20 μm in diameter) are diagnostic even in small numbers [  28  ]. The demonstration of a clonal T-cell   population in the peripheral

blood by analysis of T-cell receptor genes, using polymerase chain reaction,  appears  to  offer  high  diagnostic  specifi  city  for  Sézary syndrome. The sensitivity also appears high, but on occasions the test may need to be repeated if initial results are negative and this diagnosis is still suspected [  28  ].

Drugs. A wide range of drugs can cause erythroderma. Among the  more commonly implicated are phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, cimetidine, gold salts and lithium [  29  ]. The eruption may start as a generalized eczema, or scarlatiniform or morbilliform erythema, often accompanied by some irritation, which increases  steadily  in  severity.  Erythema  may  fi  rst  appear  in  the fl   exures,  or  over  the  whole  skin  (Figure    39.30  ).  This  group  has the best prognosis of all the causes of erythroderma [  3  ,  30  ], often resolving in 2-6 weeks [  31  ]. However, it is important to remember that  the  cutaneous  manifestations  of  drug  hypersensitivity  may be accompanied by the involvement of other organs, for example haematological abnormalities, hepatitis, nephritis or pneumonitis. An example is the DRESS syndrome (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms; see Chapter   119  ).

rythroderma  of  unknown  origin. E The  percentage  of  cases  in which no underlying disease is demonstrable diminishes with the thoroughness of investigation and the duration of observation, but in any series of cases it is rarely below 10% [  4,5  ,  31  ]. The cutaneous changes may precede any other evidence of a lymphoma by many months or years. If these cases are excluded, the remaining patients  with  chronic  erythrodermas  of  unknown  origin  consist mainly of elderly men, in whom the condition runs a very long course with partial and temporary remissions, sometimes known as the 'red man syndrome'. It is characterized by marked palmoplantar  keratoderma,  dermatopathic  lymphadenopathy  and  a raised serum IgE [  24  ,  32  ]. It is important to note that this condition

is not  established  erythrodermic  cutaneous  T-cell  lymphoma, which is occasionally referred to as 'l'homme rouge'.

The three  commonest causes  of  idiopathic  protracted  erythroderma are probably atopic eczema of the elderly, intake of drugs overlooked by the patient and prelymphomatous eruptions [  4  ].

chthyosiform  erythroderma. I This  condition  is  usually  present from birth or early infancy.

ityriasis  rubra  pilaris. P The  erythrodermic  forms  may  begin  in childhood or adult life. The presence of follicular, horny plugs on the knees and elbows, and on the backs of the fi  ngers and toes, is distinctive. In many cases, scattered islands of normal skin persist  in  the  erythrodermic  regions,  and  horny  plugs  may  be  evident around their margins. These normal pale 'islands' are very suggestive of the diagnosis, and the skin on the palms and soles often has an orange discoloration.

emphigus foliaceus. P Moist, crusted lesions on the face and upper trunk often precede the development of the erythroderma. Scaling is  conspicuous, moist and adherent. Crops of thin-walled bullae may erupt, especially on the limbs.

ichen  planus. L Erythrodermic  lichen  planus  is  very  rare  but lichenoid reactions to gold, quinine and other drugs have resulted in  erythroderma.  As  the  initial  erythema  and  oedema  subside, individual  violaceous  papules  may  be  revealed.  The  buccal mucous membrane may show typical lacy, bluish white streaks.

Dermatophytosis. Generalized  erythroderma  has  very  rarely resulted from chronic infection with organisms such as Trichophyton violaceum .

Norwegian  scabies. The  heavily  crusted  hands  and  feet,  with thickened  nails,  characteristic  of  Norwegian  scabies,  may  occasionally  be  accompanied  by  generalized  erythema  and  scaling. The condition is often mistaken for erythrodermic psoriasis. The occurrence  of  scabies  in  others  in  the  same  environment,  or  in the medical or nursing staff caring for the patient, may reveal the diagnosis.

apuloerythroderma of Ofuji P [  33-37  ].   This distinctive pattern of erythroderma was described by Ofuji in 1984 [  33  ]. It differs from ordinary erythroderma in that papulation is prominent, it tends to spare the face and fl  exures, and is often intensely pruritic. It is not yet clear whether this represents a distinct disease or a reaction pattern. Although most cases were found to be idiopathic, several have  been  reported  in  association  with  other  diseases.  Papuloerythroderma occurs in later life, with ages at diagnosis ranging from 57 to 100 years. Many cases occur in the eighth or ninth decades. Males are predominantly affected and the male : female ratio is estimated at 4.7 : 1 [  34  ].

Histological features are usually non-specifi  c. In the epidermis there are generally mild degrees of acanthosis, spongiosis, hyperkeratosis  and  focal  parakeratosis.  There  is  marked  lymphohistiocytic infi  ltration of the dermis, predominantly perivascular in distribution, and eosinophils are often conspicuous. A mild degree

of  epidermotropism has occasionally been observed and, rarely, plasma cells and multinucleate giant cells may be present. Immunofl  uorescence is negative.

The erythroderma typically begins with an eruption of brownish red, fl  at-topped papules that become confl  uent (Figure   39.31  a). The limbs and trunk are affected and the face and fl  exures tend to be spared. A characteristic and distinctive pattern of sparing of the abdominal fl  exures has been termed the 'deck chair sign' [  35  ], indicating a similarity to the distribution of sunburn in one who has been sitting out in a deck chair for too long (Figure   39.31  b). The lesions sometimes develop along scratch marks. Pruritus is a  consistent  feature  and  ranges  from  moderate  to  very  severe. Additional  features  often  observed  include  hyperkeratosis  and fissuring of the palms and soles, and benign lymphadenopathy. There is usually circulating eosinophilia and a raised IgE, as well as a mild degree of absolute or relative lymphocytopenia. In terms

of  prognosis,  papuloerythroderma  typically  persists  for  many years, although some cases have remitted.

Reports  of  papuloerythroderma  occurring  in  association  with malignancies, which have included T-cell [  36,37  ] and B-cell lymphomas [  37  ], and gastric [  37  ], lung [  37  ], colon [  38  ], prostate [  34  ] and hepatocellular [  39  ] carcinomas, would suggest that this eruption may sometimes occur as a paraneoplastic phenomenon. There are  also  several  reports  that  papuloerythroderma  may  progress into  mycosis fungoides [  34  ,  40  ,  41  ],  in  one  case  11  years  after  the onset of symptoms [  42  ]. In some cases, papuloerythroderma therefore  seems  to  be  a  presentation  of  cutaneous  T-cell  lymphoma. One case developed into psoriasis [  34  ]. Papuloerythroderma has also been reported in association with HIV infection [  43,44  ] and, in one case, biliary sepsis [  45  ].

In terms of management, emollients, topical corticosteroids and antihistamines have produced a slow response in some cases. The condition can respond well to oral prednisolone, although high doses are sometimes required. PUVA, including bath PUVA, has proved effective in several reports. Azathioprine [  46  ], ciclosporin [  47  ] and etretinate [  48  ] may be effective. Retinoids or phototherapy may be preferable to immunosuppressants because of the possible progression to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and association with malignancy.  However,  papuloerythroderma  is  sometimes  very refractory to treatment.

## Differential diagnosis

See Table   39.4 for possible underlying causes.

## Classifi  cation of severity

By defi  nition, erythroderma involves more than 90% of the body surface.

## Complications and co-morbidities

The main complications of erythroderma are haemodynamic and metabolic  disturbances.  Blood  fl  ow  through  the  skin  is  markedly increased and this can result in high-output cardiac failure, especially in elderly patients [  49,50  ]. The increased skin perfusion may lead to hypothermia [  51  ]. Fluid loss by transpiration is much increased and is  roughly  proportional  to  the  basal  metabolic  rate.  Hypoalbuminaemia is in part due to increased protein loss from exfoliated scale, which may reach 9 g/m  2  of body surface or more each day [  52  ]. This in turn results in peripheral oedema. Immune responses may become altered, refl  ected by an increase in γ -globulins or CD4+ T lymphocytopenia in the absence of HIV infection [  20  ].

## Disease course and prognosis

Erythroderma is a potentially fatal  condition.  Current  mortality rates are probably lower than historically reported, varying from 18% to 64% [  3  ,  5  ,  7  ], but erythroderma remains particularly dangerous in elderly people. Cutaneous, subcutaneous and respiratory infections  are  common and pneumonia remains the commonest cause of death [  25  ]. Complications resulting from systemic treatment of the erythroderma also contribute to   mortality rates.

The  more  frequent forms of erythroderma, including eczematous, psoriatic or of unknown origin, may continue for months or years and often follow a relapsing-remitting course [  25  ].

## nvestigations I

The greatest diagnostic yield to determine an underlying cause is obtained from multiple skin biopsies, however characteristic histological features are often lacking despite this [  53  ]. A detection of T-cell clonality in the skin or peripheral blood should be sought if lymphoma is suspected, as described above.

## Management

Treatment in hospital is frequently necessary, especially in acute and  fulminant  cases,  because  some  patients  may  develop  profound  loss  of  homeostasis.  In  these  cases  the  protein  and  electrolyte balance, circulatory status and body temperature require close monitoring. Appropriate fl  uid intake should be maintained and cardiac failure must be treated if it develops. All non-  essential drugs should be withdrawn if they might be responsible for the erythroderma.  Patients  should  be  monitored  for  infection  to ensure timely instigation of antibiotics if needed.

The  cutaneous  infl  ammation  should  be  treated  in  the  fi  rst instance  with  greasy  emollients  in  order  to  restore  skin  barrier function.  Other  topical  treatments  should  be  used  with  caution because  systemic  absorption  is  greatly  increased.  The  majority of  patients  will  improve over a week or two with this regimen, during which time the diagnosis of the underlying condition will probably  be  established.  Systemic  therapy  is  usually  necessary and will depend on the underlying cause identifi  ed. Systemic corticosteroids should be avoided for erythroderma due to psoriasis to avoid pustular transformation [  25  ].
