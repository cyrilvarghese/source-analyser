## ntroduction and general description I

The cutaneous mucinoses are a heterogeneous group of disorders whose main characteristic is abnormal mucin deposition in the skin [ 1 . Mucin or protein-hyaluronic acid complex is a nor-] mal component of the dermal extracellular matrix produced in small amounts by fi  broblasts. It is a jelly-like amorphous mixture  of  acid  glycosaminoglycans  (formerly  called  acid  mucopolysaccharides) that are repeating polysaccharides forming a complex  carbohydrate.  The  acid  glycosaminoglycans  may  be fi   xed  on  both  sides of a protein core (proteoglycan monomer) as in the case of dermatan sulphate or chondroitin-6-sulphate and chondroitin-4-sulphate, or they may be free as in the case of hyaluronic acid, which is the most important component of dermal mucin.

Mucin  is  capable  of  absorbing  1000  times  its  own  weight  in water, thus playing a major role in maintaining the salt and water balance of the dermis. However, in disease conditions, mucin is increased and since it holds water (hygroscopic), the dermal connective tissue is oedematous. Mucin may be seen on haematoxylin and eosin stains as a light blue stained material between collagen bundles;however,  to  highlight  these  changes  special  stains  are usually needed such as Alcian blue at pH 2.5 (negative at 0.4), colloidal  iron  and  toluidine  blue  at  pH  4.0.  Furthermore,  mucin  is hyaluronidase sensitive  and  periodic  acid-Schiff  (PAS)  negative [  2  . ]

Mostly  for  experimental  research,  monoclonal  or  polyclonal antibodies  have  been  used  to  detect  heparan  sulphate  proteoglycans,  the  three  isoforms  of  hyaluronan  synthase,  and the  CD44  surface  receptor  for  hyaluronate  [  3,4  , 5 . ] The  patho- genesis  of  increased  mucin  deposition  in  pathological  states is  unclear.  It  has  been  postulated  that  serum  factors  such  as cytokines  and/or  immunoglobulins  may  induce  upregulation of glycosaminoglycan synthesis. Cytokines that may play a role in  the  process  include  tumour  necrosis  factor α and β ,  interleukin 1, interleukin 6 and transforming growth factor β [ 1 .  A ] decrease in the catabolic process of mucin degradation could also be involved. Many of the cutaneous mucinoses show increased levels of polyclonal or monoclonal immunoglobulin (i.e. scleromyxoedema, pretibial myxoedema, papulonodular mucinosis of lupus erythematosus).

n Chinese Shar-Pei dogs, known for their distinctive features of I deep wrinkles, mucin deposition in the skin is a typical condition considered to be a consequence of a genetic defect in the metabolism of hyaluronic acid [  6  ].

The  cutaneous  mucinoses  are  divided  into  two  groups:  primary  (idiopathic)  cutaneous  mucinoses  in  which  the  mucin deposit is the main histological feature resulting in clinically distinctive lesions; and secondary mucinoses in which histological mucin deposition is only an additional fi  nding and secondary phenomenon (Box 59.1). Primary mucinoses can be divided into dermal  and  follicular  mucinoses.  The  former  includes  lichen myxoedematosus  (LM)  (generalized  and  localized),  reticular erythematous mucinosis (REM), scleredema, mucinoses in thyroid disease, papular and nodular mucinosis in connective tissue diseases, self-healing cutaneous mucinosis, cutaneous focal mucinosis and myxoid cyst, while the latter include Pinkus follicular mucinosis and urticaria-like follicular mucinosis. Systemic manifestations associated with mucinoses include monoclonal gammopathies  in  scleromyxoedema  and  scleredema,  diabetes

## ichen myxoedematosus L (papular mucinosis)

## Defi  nition

Lichen  myxoedematosus  is  a  comprehensive  term  to  defi  ne a  chronic,  idiopathic  cutaneous  mucinosis  characterized  by lichenoid  papules,  nodules  and/or  plaques  due  to  abnormal dermal  mucin  deposition  and  a  variable  degree  of  fi  brosis and fi  broblast  proliferation  in  the  absence  of  thyroid  disease. Two  clinicopathological  subsets  are  included:  (i)  a  generalized papular and sclerodermoid form (also called scleromyxoedema of Arndt-Gottron) with a monoclonal gammopathy and systemic,  sometimes  lethal,  manifestations;  and  (ii)  a  localized papular form which does not have systemic implications. Occasionally,  patients  with  LM  have  overlapping  or  atypical features and fall between scleromyxoedema and localized LM (Table   59.1  ) [    ]. 1

## cleromyxoedema S

## Defi  nition and nomenclature

Scleromyxoedema  is  the  sclerotic  variant  of  LM  characterized  by  a  generalized  papular  eruption  on  a  sclerodermoid background,  mucin  deposition,  increased  fi  broblast  proliferation, fi  brosis and monoclonal gammopathy [ 2 . It has systemic ] implications.

## pidemiology E

Scleromyxoedema is a rare disease that usually affects adults between the ages of 30 and 80 years. The mean age of patients is 59 years. The illness has no ethnic or sex predominance and has rarely been reported in infants and young children [ 2 . ]

## athophysiology P

The pathogenesis of scleromyxoedema is unknown. Some cytokines  such  as  tumour  necrosis  factor α and β ,  interleukin 1,  interleukin  6  and  transforming  growth  factor β and/or  polyclonal and monoclonal immunoglobulins and other unidentifi  ed

factors in the serum of affected patients may induce upregulation of glycosaminoglycan synthesis from fi  broblasts. Although monoclonal paraprotein has been considered pathogenic, the stimulation of fi  broblasts occurs even after the removal of the paraprotein. In addition, paraprotein levels usually do not correlate with the severity of disease, disease progression or the response to treatment [  3-6  ]. Finally, case reports documenting the development of scleromyxoedema following a cutaneous granulomatous reaction after  intradermal  hyaluronic  gel  injections  [  7  ]  or  after  breast

silicone implantation [ 2 may suggest a type of autoimmune syn-] drome induced by adjuvants.

## Pathology

Scleromyxoedema is characterized by a triad of microscopic features:  (Figure    59.1  a):  (i)  a  diffuse  deposit  of  mucin  composed mostly of hyaluronic acid in the upper and mid-reticular dermis confi  rmed with an Alcian blue stain at pH 2.5 (Figure   59.1  b) or an iron colloidal stain and hyaluronidase digestion; (ii) an increase

in  collagen  deposition;  and  (iii)  a  proliferation  of  irregularly arranged fi  broblasts [    ]. The epidermis may be normal or thinned, 8 the hair follicles may be atrophic and a slight perivascular superfi  cial lymphoplasmacytic infi  ltrate is often present. The elastic fi  bres are fragmented and decreased in number. Very recently, an interstitial granuloma annulare-like pattern has been described [  9  ]. In addition to skin involvement, mucin may fi  ll the endocardium, the walls of myocardial blood vessels as well as the interstitium of the kidney, lungs, pancreas, adrenal glands and nerves. Lymph node involvement may occur [  10  ].

## Clinical features

The typical skin features are those of a widespread eruption of 2-3 mm, fi  rm, waxy, closely spaced, dome shaped or fl  at-topped papules involving the dorsal aspect of the upper limbs, head and neck region, upper trunk and thighs (Figures 59.2, 59.3 and  59.4) [ 1 ,2  ].  Papules  often  are  arranged  in  a  strikingly  linear  pattern; the  surrounding  skin  is  shiny  and  thick  (i.e.  sclerodermoid  in

appearance). Rarely, non-tender nodules may develop. The glabella  typically  is  involved  with  deep  longitudinal  folding  that gives the appearance of a leonine face (Figure   59.5  ). Deep furrowing is  also  evident  on  the  trunk,  shoulders  and  limbs  (Shar-Pei  sign) (Figure   59.6  ).  Erythema,  oedema  and  a  brownish  discoloration may be seen in the involved areas; itching is not uncommon. Eyebrow, axillary and pubic hair may be sparse. Mucosal lesions are absent. As the condition progresses, erythematous and infi  ltrated plaques develop with skin stiffening, sclerodactyly and reduced mobility of the mouth and the joints of the hands, arms and legs. Over  the  proximal  interphalangeal  joints,  a  central  depression surrounded by an elevated rim (due to the skin thickening) is referred  to  as  the  'doughnut  sign'  (Figure    59.7  ).  Telangiectasia  and  calcinosis  are  lacking  but  Raynaud  phenomenon  may rarely occur.

## Complications and co-morbidities

Systemic implications are listed in Table   59.3  .

## Disease course and prognosis

The prognosis of scleromyxoedema is variable. Scleromyxoedema follows a chronic, progressive and sometimes unpredictable course [ 2 . Involvement of the central nervous system, heart, kidney or pro-] gression to overt myeloma worsens the prognosis. The main causes of death include dermatoneuro syndrome (scleromyxoedema with concomitant fever, convulsions and coma), cardiovascular complications and haematological malignancies [ 2 . Septic complications ] are mostly linked to melphalan therapy that is now less commonly used [  13  ].  In  a  recent  case  series,  fi  ve  (23.8%)  of  21  patients  had died, whereas 12 were alive with disease and four alive without disease after a mean follow-up period of 33.5 months [ 2 . ]

## nvestigations I

n addition to skin biopsy, serum and electrophoresis with immuI nofi  xation  is  mandatory.  Thyroid  function  test  results  are  normal. Findings of other laboratory test are usually normal, except in cases of specifi  c extracutaneous symptoms where the internal organs affected should be evaluated. There is little value in imaging studies, although high-resolution cutaneous ultrasonography may become a useful diagnostic and disease activity monitoring tool for skin thickening.

## Management

There is no evidence to support any specifi  c defi  nitive treatment for scleromyxoedema because of the rarity of the disorder with a limited number of case reports along with the lack of randomized controlled trials and the incomplete aetiopathogenetic understanding of the disease. In addition, signifi  cant toxicity, including death,

often associated with some therapies such as melphalan, make therapeutic choices more diffi  cult (see Table   59.2  ). Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (alone or in combination with other drugs) has gained widespread acceptance as the fi  rst line therapy for both skin involvement  and  extracutaneous  manifestations,  and  especially for  acute  deterioration  of  the  clinical  condition  with  neurological symptoms [    ,  21-22  ]. Although remissions persisting for a few 2 months to 3 years after cessation of intravenous immunoglobulin infusions have been reported, the response is not permanent and maintenance infusions spaced out to every 6-8 weeks are required [  23  ].  Thalidomide (or lenalidomide) and/or systemic steroids are considered the second line of treatment, more often in combination with intravenous immunoglobulins than as monotherapy [  24-28  ]. Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation can be considered as a third line of treatment [  29  ]. The association of bortezomib  and  dexamethasone  targeting  plasma  cell  dyscrasia  has been  suggested  for  recurrences  after  autologous  stem  cell  transplantation and also for dermatoneuro syndrome [  30-31  ].

## ocalized lichen myxoedematosus L

## ntroduction and general description I

n localized LM, patients have small fi  rm waxy papules (or nodI ules and plaques produced by the confl  uence of papules) confi  ned to  only  a  few  sites.  There  are  no  sclerotic  features,  no  paraproteinaemia, no systemic involvement and no association with thyroid disease. Localized LM is classifi  ed into four subtypes: (i) acral persistent papular mucinosis; (ii) discrete papular lichen myxoedmatosus; (iii) cutaneous (papular) mucinosis of infancy; and (iv) nodular lichen myxoedmatosus [  1  ].

## pidemiology E

The exact incidence and prevalence rates of the variants of localized  LM are unknown as they are rare diseases. Both sexes are equally affected in discrete papular LM. A female predominance (female : male ratio of 3 : 1) has been noted in acral persistent papular mucinosis.

## athology P

n  localized  LM,  the  histological  changes  are  less  characteristic I than in scleromyxoedema. Mucin accumulates in the upper and mid reticular dermis, fi  broblast proliferation is variable and fi  brosis  is  not  marked  and  may  even  be  absent.  In  acral  persistent papular mucinosis, mucin accumulates focally in the upper reticular dermis (sparing a subepidermal zone) and fi  broblasts are not increased in number (Figure   59.8  a, b). In cutaneous mucinosis of infancy, the mucin may be so superfi  cial as to look as if it were 'enclosed' by epidermis [  1  ,  8  ] but mucin deposition may also occur in the reticular dermis.

## Clinical features

n I acral  persistent  papular  mucinosis , multiple  ivory  to  skin-coloured  papules  develop  exclusively  on  the  dorsal  aspect  of  the hands  and  extensor  surface  of  the  distal  forearms  (Figure    59.9  ) [  32,33  ]. Discrete papular LM presents with reddish, violaceous or

[  35  ]. Nodular LM is characterized by multiple nodules on the limbs and trunk, with a mild or absent papular component [  36  ]. Localized lichen myxoedematosus may be observed in association with HIV infection, exposure to toxic oil or l-tryptophan, or hepatitis C virus infection. Localized cutaneous mucinosis resembling LM or plaque-like mucinosis after joint replacement and familial forms of  papular  mucinosis  have  also  been  reported  [  37-39  ].  Whether they are distinct entities or atypical and/or familial forms of localized LM is, however, still unclear.

## Differential diagnosis

Histological examination of the skin helps to distinguish localized  LM  from  several  papular  eruptions  that  have  a  similar appearance,  such  as  granuloma  annulare,  lichen  amyloidosus, lichen planus  and  other  lichenoid  eruptions,  and  eruptive collagenoma.

## Disease course and prognosis

Localized  lichen  myxoedematosus  in  all  its  variants  runs  a chronic but benign course in the absence of systemic involvement. Progression to scleromyxoedema has never been proven.

## Management

Localized LM is a benign condition that often does not require any therapy (a 'wait and see' approach). Many treatments have been tried including dermabrasion, CO2 laser, electrocoagulation, topical  and  intralesional  corticosteroids  or  hyaluronidase  injections, oral  retinoids  and  psoralen  ultraviolet  A  (PUVA)  with  variable results. Topical calcineurin inhibitors [  40  ] may be of some benefi  t. However, spontaneous resolution may occur, even in the setting of HIV-associated cases [  41  ].

## Reticular erythematous mucinosis

## Defi  nition and nomenclature

Reticular erythematous mucinosis is a rare, chronic primary cutaneous mucinosis characterized by a persistent reticular macular erythema or erythematous papules and plaques in the midline of the back or chest.

## Synonyms and inclusions

- •  Plaque-like cutaneous mucinosis
- •  Reticular erythematous mucinosis syndrome
- •  Midline mucinosis

## Epidemiology

Reticular erythematous mucinosis is a rare disease that has been described  worldwide  in  patients  with  different  ethnic  backgrounds. It affects predominantly middle-aged women, although men and children are not spared [    ]. 1

## Associated diseases

In  general,  REM  is  not  related  to  systemic  diseases.  However, certain  disorders,  especially  malignancies  (e.g.  haematological, breast, lung, colon) and thyroid dysfunction have been sometimes associated  [ 1 2 , .  Autoimmune  disorders  such  as  systemic  lupus ] erythematosus,  diabetes,  idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  purpura and also HIV infection have been anecdotally reported in patients with REM [    ]. 2

## Pathophysiology

The aetiopathogenesis is unclear. Viral diseases and immunological disturbances have been implicated. The fi  broblasts of patients with REM exhibit an abnormal response to stimulation by exogenous interleukin [  3  ].

## Predisposing factors

Although  REM  has  been  considered  a  photoaggravated  disorder,  the  role  of  sunlight  is  actually  controversial  [ 1 . ] Oral contraceptives, pregnancy, menses, heat, X-ray therapy and perspiration have been also implicated to promote or exacerbate REM [ 2 .  Familial cases suggesting a genetic predisposition have been ] reported [    ]. 4

## Pathology

Interstitial deposits of mucin are seen in the upper dermis, along with a perivascular and, at times, perifollicular T-cell infi  ltrate with variable deep perivascular extension. There is slight vascular dilatation. The epidermis is typically normal. Usually, direct immunofl  uorescence is negative, but, rarely, granular deposits of  immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin A and C3 have been seen at the dermal-epidermal junction [ 5 . ]

## Clinical features

Reticular erythematous mucinosis is characterized by erythematous macules and indurated papules or plaque-like lesions with a reticular confi  guration and lack of scale or other surface changes in the midline of the chest (Figure   59.11  ) or back. Atypical areas such as the arms, abdomen, face and legs are occasionally involved. The lesions are occasionally pruritic.

## Differential diagnosis

There may be signifi  cant overlap between REM and lupus erythematosus  tumidus.  Both  conditions  show  clinical  and  histological  similarities,  lack  immune  serological  abnormalities, respond  well  to  antimalarials  and  resolve  without  residual lesions.  However,  patients  with  lupus  tumidus  who  do  not exhibit reticulate-patterned lesions on the midline, are strongly photosensitive,  have  a  higher  rate  of  immune  reactants  on direct  immunofl  uorescence,  have  a  higher  tendency  to  recur and  occasionally  present  with  other  clinical  manifestations of  lupus  [  6  ].  Seborrhoeic  dermatitis  and  pityriasis  versicolor involve  the  central  chest,  but  they  have  associated  scale  and different colour, as has confl  uent and reticulated papillomatosis of Gougerot-Carteaud.

## Disease course and prognosis

Reticular  erythematous  mucinosis  is  a  chronic  disease  that,  if untreated, has a prolonged duration. The lesions may clear spontaneously, even after 15 years.

## nvestigations I

n  general,  REM  is  not  associated  with  abnormal  laboratory I tests.

## Management

Antimalarials  (e.g.  hydroxychloroquine)  are  the  fi  rst  line  of treatment and they generally result in improvement or healing of the lesions within 1-2 months [  7  ]. Relapses are not uncommon. Results from other therapies such as topical and systemic corticosteroids, topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, oral antihistamines,  tetracycline,  ciclosporin  and  pulsed  dye  laser  are quite variable [ 2 8,9  ]. Despite the potential for an exacerbation, , successful  results  with  UVB  and  UVA1  irradiation  have  been reported [  10,11  ].

## ntroduction and general description I

Scleredema is a rare condition characterized by a non-pitting induration of the upper part of the body, associated with diabetes or with a history of infection or blood dyscrasia [    ]. 1

## Epidemiology

Scleredema is rare and occurs in patients of all ages and ethnic backgrounds. The age distribution varies with the different subtypes. Among patients with diabetes, scleredema has been diagnosed  in  2.5-14%.  The  form  that  is  associated  with  diabetes  is more prevalent in men (10 : 1), while other forms are seen more commonly in women (2 : 1) [  2,3  ].

## Associated diseases

Scleredema can be divided into a diabetic and non-diabetic type (see Box 59.1). The former is considered the most common type accounting for 25-50% of cases. It occurs mainly in obese middleaged men with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes [  3,4  ]. The non-diabetic form includes an idiopathic type; a post-infective type with acute onset, usually following a streptococcal upper respiratory infection but also infl  uenza, measles, mumps, chickenpox, cytomegalovirus, diphtheria, encephalitis and dental abscesses; a monoclonal gammopathy-associated type; and a type associated with anecdotal miscellaneous conditions such as autoimmune disorders (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, Sjögren syndrome,  dermatomyositis,  anaphylactoid  purpura),  internal malignancies (malignant insulinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, carcinoid tumour, pituitary-adrenocortical neoplasms), exposure to organic solvents and HIV infection [  2  ,  5  ,  6  ].

## Pathophysiology

The pathogenesis is unknown. An increase of type 1 collagen synthesis by dysfunctional fi  broblasts has been demonstrated in the affected skin. In diabetic scleredema, the accumulation of collagen may be due to irreversible non-enzymatic glycosylation of collagen and resistance to degradation by collagenase. Alternatively, excess stimulation by insulin, microvascular damage and hypoxia may induce the abnormal synthesis of collagen and mucin. Streptococcal hypersensitivity, injury to lymphatics and paraproteinaemia may also play a role.

## Pathology

The  epidermis  is  not  involved.  The  dermis  is  3-4  times  thicker than  normal.  The  collagen  fi  bres  appear  swollen  and  are  separated by wide spaces. Acid mucopolysaccharides are found in the fenestrated spaces with special stains. However, negative staining does not exclude the diagnosis. The subcutaneous tissue is also involved with fat being replaced by coarse collagen fi  bres. A slight perivascular lymphocytic infi  ltrate may be seen but it is uncommon [  7  ]. Fibroblast proliferation is absent. Mucin also accumulates in skeletal muscle and the heart.

## Clinical features

Scleredema  is  characterized  by  fi  rm  non-pitting  oedema  and induration  that  typically  begin  on  the  posterior  neck  and spread to the upper back (Figure   59.12  ), shoulders and scalp. Erythema and a peau d'orange appearance of the skin are commonly  observed.  The  hands  and  feet  are  characteristically spared. Unusual cases with limited site involvement have been reported  [  8  ].  Depending  on  the  involved  sites,  patients  often

complain of a movement restriction comprising limited body mobility  and  facial  expressions,  or  diffi  culties  in  mastication and articulation.

## Differential diagnosis

n  contrast  to  systemic  sclerosis,  scleredema  is  not  associated I with  sclerodactyly,  Raynaud  phenomenon,  nail  fold  capillary changes or serum autoantibodies. Additional differential diagnoses include myxoedema, amyloidosis, lymphoedema, cellulitis, dermatomyositis, trichinosis and oedema of cardiac or renal origin.

## Complications and co-morbidities

Systemic involvement in scleredema is not frequent. Extracutaneous complications (in all forms) include serositis, dysarthria, dysphagia,  myositis,  parotitis,  hepatosplenomegaly  and  ocular  and cardiac abnormalities [  9  ].

## Disease course and prognosis

Prognosis is largely dependent on the underlying aetiology. Postinfectious scleredema runs a benign course because it is self-limiting  in  duration  and  resolves  spontaneously  within  6  months  to 2 years. Scleredema associated with diabetes or monoclonal gammopathy runs a chronic and disabling course with little tendency to  remission.  Rarely  death  may  occur  when  internal  organs  are involved.

## nvestigations I

Laboratory investigations are useful for detecting an underlying disorder. A recent infection should be excluded (with throat swab culture and antistreptolysin titres). Fasting blood glucose or  glycosylated  haemoglobin  measurements  and  serum  protein  electrophoresis  and  immunofi  xation  should  be  obtained. Ultrasonography  can  be  performed  to  evaluate  skin  thickness at baseline and after treatment while magnetic resonance imaging  may  be  useful  for  determining  the  extent  of  disease progression due to better soft-tissue contrast than ultrasound evaluation [  10  ].

## Management

The  therapy  of  scleredema  is  quite  difficult  and  has  limited success. At  present,  no  effective  treatment  is  known  for  this disease. For patients with disabling manifestations, initial treatment with phototherapy is suggested as first choice (grade of recommendation: weak). UVA1, PUVA and narrow-band UVB have all been found to be effective [  11  , 12 . Therapy is unneces-] sary  for  scleroderma  associated  with  streptococcal  infections because it resolves spontaneously. In patients with associated conditions,  the  disorder  can  resolve  or  improve  if  treatment of  the  primary  disease  is  successful.  In  patients  with  scleredema-associated  multiple  myeloma,  therapy  targeting  the plasma cell dyscrasia such as bortezomib may be effective [ 13 . ] Some but not all patients with diabetes-associated scleredema appear  to  improve  with  better  glucose  control.  Other  therapies that have been tried, with reduced patient numbers and overall  limited  success,  include  immunosuppressive  agents

such as ciclosporin A and methotrexate, high-dose penicillin, corticosteroids  (local,  intralesional  and  systemic),  tamoxifen and  allopurinol  [  14  ].  Electron-beam  radiotherapy  and  extracorporeal  photopheresis  may  also  give  some  improvement [  15-16  ].  Intravenous  immunoglobulin  seems  to  be  a  promising therapy [  17  ]. Patients with motion or respiratory disability should be referred to a physical therapist for musculoskeletal rehabilitation.

## Myxoedema in thyroid diseases

## ocalized (pretibial) myxoedema L

## Defi  nition and nomenclature

Localized  (pretibial)  myxoedema  is  an  infi  ltrative  dermopathy  due  to  mucin  deposition,  usually  arising  on  the  shins.  It is  one  of  the  signs  of  hyperthyroidism,  especially  of  Graves disease [  1  ].

## ynonyms and inclusions S

- •    Thyroid dermopathy
- •    Infiltrative dermopathy

## Epidemiology

## ncidence and prevalence I

Localized (pretibial) myxoedema is found in 1-5% of patients with Graves disease, but in up to 25% of patients who have exophthalmus. Women are affected more often than men (3 : 1) with a peak of incidence at age 50-60 years [  2  ].

## Pathophysiology

The  demonstration of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor protein  expression  by  normal  dermal  fi  broblasts  suggests  that  thyroidstimulating  hormone  receptor  antibodies  may  stimulate  the production of mucin from these cells. Some cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor α and γ interferon secreted by T helper 1 lymphocytes activated by thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antigen could also induce glycosaminoglycan synthesis from fi   broblasts.  Fibroblasts  from  the  dermis  of  the  lower  extremities  have  been  found  to  be  more  sensitive  to  this  factor  than are fi  broblasts from other areas of the body [ 2 3-5  ]. Insulin-like , growth factor 1 receptor antibodies, trauma, tobacco and lymphatic obstruction may also play a role.

## Pathology

Histopathology  reveals  hyperkeratosis  with  follicular  plugging, acanthosis  and  sometimes  papillomatosis.  The  reticular  dermis, particularly the mid to the lower part, shows separation of collagen bundles by large quantities of mucin. A perivascular lymphocytic  infi  ltrate  and  an  increase  in  mast  cells  may  be  found with normal or increased number of fi  broblasts. Elastic fi  bres are reduced in number [ 2 . ]

## Clinical features

Pretibial myxoedema is one of the signs of Graves disease (along with goitre, exophthalmus, thyroid acropathy, and high circulating levels of long-acting thyroid-stimulating hormone). Less commonly, it has been described with Hashimoto thyroiditis and in patients with no past or present history of thyroid dysfunction. It is characterized by bilateral thickening and induration of the skin on the shins and dorsa of the feet.  There  are  four  main  clinical variants: diffuse non-pitting oedema (43%) (Figure   59.13  ); plaque type (27%); nodular (18%) (Figure   59.14  ); and elephantiasis (5%)

(Figure   59.15  ) [    ,  6  ]. The lesions can vary in colour and may exhibit 2 a characteristic orange peel appearance and texture due to prominent hair follicles. The toes, thighs, upper extremities and face can be involved (Figure   59.16  ) [  7  ]. Overlying hyperhidrosis or hypertrichosis may be associated.

## Differential diagnosis

In addition to lichen simplex chronicus and hypertrophic lichen planus in which mucin is lacking, pretibial myxoedema should be differentiated from obesity-associated lymphoedematous mucinosis seen in patients without thyroid disease [    ]. 8

## Disease course and prognosis

Apart  from  the  appearance,  associated  morbidity  is  usually not  severe,  except  for  patients  with  elephantiasis  who  are less  likely  to  have  remission.  Entrapment  of  peroneal  nerves by mucinous connective tissue may cause foot drop or faulty dorsifl  exion.

## nvestigations I

Thyroid-stimulating hormone is abnormally low and long-acting thyroid stimulator antibodies are elevated in 50% of patients with Graves disease.

## Management

The initial treatment includes minimizing risk factors, such as reducing weight, reducing tobacco use and normalizing thyroid function.  However,  therapy  for  the  associated  hyperthyroidism does not improve the cutaneous lesions and, often, localized myxoedema develops after treatment has been instituted. Severe myxoedema is most often encountered in patients with longstanding  untreated  Graves  thyroid  disease.  The  fi  rst  line of pharmacological therapy is medium to high potency topical

corticosteroids applied under occlusive dressings or delivered by  intralesional  injection  (grade  of  recommendation:  weak) [  2 ,9  , 10  ].  For  the severe elephantiasic form, rituximab, plasmapheresis,  intravenous  immunoglobulins  and  octreotide  with and without surgical shave removal have been tried with some benefi  t in uncontrolled case reports [  11-13  ]. Usually, skin grafting  is  followed  by  relapse.  The  use  of  compression  stockings and gradient pneumatic compression is useful as it improves lymphedema. Localized myxoedema may clear spontaneously (on average after 3.5 years) [ 14 . ]

## apular and nodular mucinosis in P connective tissue diseases

## Defi  nition

A  distinctive  cutaneous  mucinosis  characterized  by  skin-coloured papules, nodules (Figure   59.17  a) and plaque-like lesions on  the  trunk  and  upper  extremities  may  accompany  or  even antedate a connective tissue disease, mostly lupus erythematosus (cutaneous lupus mucinosis) and rarely dermatomyositis or scleroderma [ 1 . ]

## Epidemiology

Cutaneous  lupus  mucinosis  occurs  in  1.5%  of  patients  with lupus erythematosus in the fourth and fi  fth decades of life, with a   predominance of adult males in Asian patients and females in Caucasian cases [  2  ].

## Pathophysiology

The  pathogenesis  is  unknown  but  increased  glycosaminoglycan production  by  dermal  fi  broblasts  stimulated  by  some  cytokines or immunoglobulins, or an abnormal immune response linked to human leukocyte antigens HLAB8 and HLADR3 haplotypes have been suggested [  1,2  ].

## Pathology

Histologically,  mucin  is  abundant  throughout  the  dermis  and sometimes  subcutaneous  fat  (Figure    59.17  b), occasionally  in association  with  a  slight  to  moderate  perivascular  lymphocytic

![Image](cropped_3000f6ad-93af-4775-a4c6-bcbf1c42decd-with-image-refs_artifacts\image_000018_ac1fdccabfecf8a382084d7a7e32be2c40862c70f2e50df419a4408d82842fe5.png)

infi  ltrate.  The  epidermal  changes  of  lupus  erythematosus  are absent or mild, but a positive lupus band is seen on direct immunofl  uorescence [  ,2  ]. 1

## Clinical features

The clinical course may or may not be related to the underlying connective  tissue  disease  activity.  Usually,  patients  with  lupus erythematosus who develop papular and nodular mucinosis have systemic disease in about 75% of cases, but discoid and subacute cutaneous  lupus  erythematosus  may  also  be  associated  with  it. Periorbital  mucinosis  is  an  unusual  presentation  [  3  ].  Cutaneous mucinosis in dermatomyositis usually follows the myositis and is characterized by erythematous nodules and plaque-like lesions on the trunk [  4  ]. The development of papular and nodular mucinosis has also been associated with scleroderma both the systemic and the cutaneous form [  5  ].

## Management

Therapy of papular and nodular mucinosis is the same as for the  connective  tissue  disease.  However,  the  evolution  of  the mucinoses does not always follow the course of the underlying disease. Sunscreens, topical or intralesional corticosteroids, and oral antimalarials can be effective in cutaneous lupus mucinosis.  Systemic  corticosteroids  and  oral  tacrolimus  are  used  for resistant cases [    ]. 6

## elf-healing cutaneous mucinosis S

## Defi  nition

A  self-healing  mucinosis  affecting  young  people  with  transient cutaneous lesions and mild infl  ammatory symptoms.

## ntroduction and general description I

Self-healing  juvenile  cutaneous  mucinosis  is  a  rare  disease  of unknown aetiology occurring in young people (from 13 months to 15 years of age) characterized by transient cutaneous lesions and sometimes mild infl  ammatory symptoms [  1  ].

## Pathophysiology

Abnormal mucin production and fi  broblast proliferation are suggested  to  be  secondary  to  a  reactive  or  reparative  response  to chronic  antigenic  stimulation,  as  can  occur  in  viral  infection  or infl  ammation.

## Pathology

Histologically,  papular  lesions  show  mucin  deposition  with mild  infl  ammation  and  a  small  increase  in  fi  broblasts  while nodules show deep mucinous areas associated with bands of fi   brosis, multiple capillaries, fi  broblastic proliferation and gangliocyte-like giant cells in the subcutis consistent with nodular or proliferative fasciitis [ 2 . ]

## Clinical features

Self-healing  cutaneous  mucinosis  is  characterized  by  the  following  criteria:  (i)  acute  eruption  of  multiple  papules,  sometimes  in  linear  infi  ltrated  plaques,  on  the  face,  neck,  scalp, abdomen and thighs; (ii) mucinous subcutaneous nodules on the face with periorbital swelling and on periarticular areas of the limbs which sometimes are the predominant lesions (Figure 59.18  ); (iii) systemic symptoms such as fever, arthralgias, weakness and muscle tenderness in the absence of paraproteinaemia, bone marrow plasmocytosis and thyroid dysfunction; and (iv) spontaneous resolution in a period ranging from a few weeks to many months (usually from 2 to 8) [ 1 . It has also been described ] in adults [  3  ].

## Management

Despite  the  worrying  presentation,  the  disease  heals  spontaneously and aggressive therapy should be avoided.

## Cutaneous focal mucinosis

## Defi  nition

Cutaneous focal mucinosis is a benign localized form of cutaneous dermal mucinosis.

## ntroduction and general description I

Cutaneous focal mucinosis is a benign localized form of cutaneous dermal mucinosis.

## pidemiology E

Cutaneous focal mucinosis occurs in adults of either sex but it has also been reported in children [    ]. 1

## athophsiology P

Cutaneous focal mucinosis is a reactive lesion in which trauma may act as a trigger [  1  ].

## Pathology

The  histology  is  essential  for  diagnosis  and  shows  a  diffuse ill-defi  ned dermal  accumulation  of  mucin,  sparing  subcutaneous  tissue,  with  normal  or  slight  increase  of  fi  broblasts and absence of infl  ammation [    , 1 2  ]. Spindle-shaped fi   broblasts are the predominant cell type, with occasional admixed factor  XIIIa-positive  dendritic  cells.  The  epidermis  may  be normal or hyperplastic, sometimes forming a collarette. Additionally, absence of elastic fi  bres without increased vascularity is seen.

## Clinical features

Cutaneous  focal  mucinosis  presents  as  an  asymptomatic  solitary  skin-coloured  papule  or  nodule,  sometimes  with  cystic

appearance, that can occur anywhere on the body (Figure   59.19  ) or in the oral cavity, but not in proximity to the joints of the hands, wrists or feet [    ].  Occasionally,  cutaneous  focal  muci1 nosis  has  been  reported  as  a  soft  fibroma-like  polyp  or  a plaque-like  lesion  [  2,3  ].  Multiple  lesions  have  been  rarely described [  4  ].

## Differential diagnosis

The main differential diagnosis is with angiomyxoma, a benign neoplasm which is larger (size over 1 cm), and shows subcutaneous involvement by mucin and increased vascularity [  5  ].

## Complications and co-morbidities

Contrary to other forms of primary mucinoses, cutaneous focal mucinosis  is  not  usually  related  to  systemic  manifestations. Anecdotal associations with hypothyroidism and myxoedema or  other  forms  of  mucinoses  such  as  scleromyxoedema  and REM, and with antitumour necrosis factor α therapy, have been described [  4  ,  6  ].

## Management

Surgical excision is the treatment  of choice and  relapse is uncommon.

## Digital myxoid (mucous) cyst

## Defi  nition

Digital myxoid cyst is a benign ganglion cyst of the digits.

## Epidemiology

Women are affected more than twice as often as men.

## Pathophysiology

There are two varieties of lesion: ganglion type derived from joint fluid and synovial cells, which is located over the joints; and myxomatous  type,  derived  from  dermal-based  fi  broblasts,  which  is located between the interphalangeal joints.

## Pathology

Histopathological  features  show  a  large  deposit  of  mucin-containing  stellate  fi  broblasts,  some  vascular  spaces  and  multiple clefts.  The  overlying  epidermis  is  acanthotic  laterally  and  more atrophic centrally. Transepidermal elimination of mucoid material may be seen.

## Clinical features

It  is  a translucent dome-shaped soft or fl  uctuant 3-10 mm nodule with or without visible semi-transparent contents located on the  dorsal  skin  on  or  near  a  distal  interphalangeal  joint  of  the fi   nger in middle-aged patients (Figure   59.20  ) [ 1 . Cysts may also ] be found on the toes. The surface may be smooth or verrucous. Subungual and multiple forms have been reported [  2  ]. Clinical and radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis is common. Grooving of the nail may associate or even precede the cyst itself by up to 6 months [  3  ]. Antecedent trauma has been documented in a small minority of cases. A connection of the ganglion cyst to the underlying joint can be shown by means of magnetic resonance imaging [  4  ]. Puncture or biopsy results in the drainage of viscous mucin from the cyst.

## Management

None of the existing  treatments  is  consistently  successful.  Digital myxoid cyst can be excised but relapse is not uncommon and many dermatologists tend to favor more conservative treatments such as multiple needling or aspiration followed by steroid injection, sclerosant injection, cryotherapy, infrared coagulation or CO 2 laser [  5  ].

## OLLICULAR MUCINOSES F

Mucin  accumulates  in  the  epithelial  hair  follicle  sheaths  and sebaceous glands in two primary (idiopathic) distinctive clinical  disorders:  Pinkus  follicular  mucinosis  and  urticaria-like follicular  mucinosis  [  1  ].  Follicular  mucinosis  can  also  occur as  a  histological  epiphenomenon  most  often  seen  in  cutaneous  T-cell  lymphomas  (see  Chapter  140)  and  other  skin diseases [  2  ].

## inkus follicular mucinosis P

## Defi  nition and nomenclature

Pinkus follicular mucinosis is an uncommon infl  ammatory disorder, apparently not linked with lymphoma, that has a predilection for  children,  and  for  adults  in  the  third  and  fourth  decades  of life [  1  ].

## Synonyms and inclusions

- •  Alopecia mucinosa
- •  Follicular mucinosis
- •  Mucinosis follicularis

## Pathophysiology

It is far from clear why dermal-type mucin is deposited selectively within  an  epithelial  structure.  Although  follicular  keratinocytes have been considered to be the source of the mucin, an aetiological role  for  cell-mediated  immune  mechanisms  has  been  proposed. A reaction to persistent antigens such as Staphylococcus aureus has also been considered [  1  ]. Familial cases suggest a genetic predisposition [  3  ].

## Pathology

Mucin  accumulates  within  the  follicular  epithelium  and  sebaceous glands causing keratinocytes to disconnect from each other (Figure   59.21  c, d). In more advanced lesions, the follicles are converted into cystic spaces containing mucin, infl  ammatory cells and altered  keratinocytes.  A  perifollicular  infi  ltrate  of  lymphocytes, histiocytes  and  eosinophils  is  seen.  The  differentiation  between Pinkus follicular mucinosis and mycosis fungoides-associated follicular  mucinosis is  very  diffi  cult  and  there  is  no  single  reliable criterion. Although the existence of primary follicular mucinosis has  been  questioned,  as  it  has  been  considered  as  an  'indolent' localized form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, clues in favour of a primary form are the young age of the patient, a solitary lesion on the head or neck and the absence of histological features of epidermotropism or atypical lymphocytes [ 4 5 , . Clonal T-cell rearrange-] ment is not always useful to differentiate the two types. In these cases, clinical follow-up is mandatory.

## Clinical features

Pinkus  follicular  mucinosis  presents  as  an  acute  or  subacute eruption  characterized  by  one  or  several  sharply  demarcated erythematous plaques with follicular prominence (Figure 59.21  a),  scaling  and  alopecia  (Figure    59.21  b)  [  1  ,  5  ].  Nodules, annular  plaques,  folliculitis,  follicular  spines,  acneform  eruptions  and  alopecia  areata-like  presentation  [  6  ]  have  also  been described. A second type which is characterized by a more generalized chronic form in a slightly older age group, with larger and  more  numerous  plaques  on  the  extremities,  trunk  and face, is probably best regarded as a follicular mucinosis associated with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma rather than a primary condition.

## Management

There is no specifi  c treatment for Pinkus follicular mucinosis [  3  ]. A wait and see approach should be considered as many cases heal spontaneously in 2-24 months. Topical, intralesional and systemic corticosteroids,  topical  retinoids,  topical  calcineurin  inhibitors, topical bexarotene, imiquimod, dapsone, antimalarials, indometacin, minocycline, oral isotretinoin, interferon α -2b, photodynamic therapy and UVA1 phototherapy have been reported to be of benefi  t on an anecdotal basis [  7-9  ].

## Urticaria-like follicular mucinosis

## Defi  nition

A follicular  mucinosis  presenting  with  a  cyclic  eruption  of  urticaria-like  lesions  on  the  face  on  a  'rosaceiform  or  seborrhoeic' background.

## ntroduction and general description I

This  is  a  very  rare  cyclic  eruption  of  urticaria-like  lesions  that occurs  primarily  on  the  head  of  middle-aged  men  [  10  ]  in  the absence of systemic manifestations.

## Pathology

On  histopathological  examination  urticaria-like  follicular  mucinosis  presents  with  mucin  deposition  inside  the  hair  follicles associated  with  a  perivascular  and  perifollicular  infi  ltrate  of ymphocytes and eosinophils. Rearrangement of T-cell receptors l is more frequently polyclonal and it is not decisive in the differential diagnosis.

## Clinical features

Urticaria-like  follicular  mucinosis  presents  with  recurrent  pruritic  urticarial  papules  and  plaques  of  the  face  and  neck  on  a

'rosaceiform or seborrhoeic' background. As lesions resolve, red macules  persist  for  a  few  weeks.  Hair-bearing  regions  may  be involved, but neither follicular plugging nor alopecia is seen. The diagnosis is usually delayed since the dermatitis is often misinterpreted as urticaria, seborrhoeic dermatitis, rosacea or lupus tumidus before a biopsy is taken.

## Management

Urticaria-like follicular mucinosis has a good prognosis although it may last up to 15 years. Therapy is diffi  cult. Antimalarials and dapsone have been reported as benefi  cial [  10  ].

## ECONDARY MUCINOSES S

Secondary cutaneous mucinoses include all those entities in which mucin  deposition  simply  represents  an  additional  histological finding and not the main feature (see Box 59.1) [  1  ].
