        <h2>ntroduction and general description I</h2>
        <p>The cutaneous mucinoses are a heterogeneous group of disorders whose main characteristic is abnormal mucin
            deposition in the skin [ 1 . Mucin or protein-hyaluronic acid complex is a nor-] mal component of the dermal
            extracellular matrix produced in small amounts by fi broblasts. It is a jelly-like amorphous mixture of acid
            glycosaminoglycans (formerly called acid mucopolysaccharides) that are repeating polysaccharides forming a
            complex carbohydrate. The acid glycosaminoglycans may be fi xed on both sides of a protein core
            (proteoglycan monomer) as in the case of dermatan sulphate or chondroitin-6-sulphate and
            chondroitin-4-sulphate, or they may be free as in the case of hyaluronic acid, which is the most important
            component of dermal mucin.</p>
        <p>Mucin is capable of absorbing 1000 times its own weight in water, thus playing a major role in maintaining
            the salt and water balance of the dermis. However, in disease conditions, mucin is increased and since it
            holds water (hygroscopic), the dermal connective tissue is oedematous. Mucin may be seen on haematoxylin and
            eosin stains as a light blue stained material between collagen bundles;however, to highlight these changes
            special stains are usually needed such as Alcian blue at pH 2.5 (negative at 0.4), colloidal iron and
            toluidine blue at pH 4.0. Furthermore, mucin is hyaluronidase sensitive and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)
            negative [ 2 . ]</p>
        <p>Mostly for experimental research, monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies have been used to detect heparan
            sulphate proteoglycans, the three isoforms of hyaluronan synthase, and the CD44 surface receptor for
            hyaluronate [ 3,4 , 5 . ] The patho- genesis of increased mucin deposition in pathological states is
            unclear. It has been postulated that serum factors such as cytokines and/or immunoglobulins may induce
            upregulation of glycosaminoglycan synthesis. Cytokines that may play a role in the process include tumour
            necrosis factor α and β , interleukin 1, interleukin 6 and transforming growth factor β [ 1 . A ] decrease
            in the catabolic process of mucin degradation could also be involved. Many of the cutaneous mucinoses show
            increased levels of polyclonal or monoclonal immunoglobulin (i.e. scleromyxoedema, pretibial myxoedema,
            papulonodular mucinosis of lupus erythematosus).</p>
        <p>n Chinese Shar-Pei dogs, known for their distinctive features of I deep wrinkles, mucin deposition in the
            skin is a typical condition considered to be a consequence of a genetic defect in the metabolism of
            hyaluronic acid [ 6 ].</p>
        <p>The cutaneous mucinoses are divided into two groups: primary (idiopathic) cutaneous mucinoses in which the
            mucin deposit is the main histological feature resulting in clinically distinctive lesions; and secondary
            mucinoses in which histological mucin deposition is only an additional fi nding and secondary phenomenon
            (Box 59.1). Primary mucinoses can be divided into dermal and follicular mucinoses. The former includes
            lichen myxoedematosus (LM) (generalized and localized), reticular erythematous mucinosis (REM), scleredema,
            mucinoses in thyroid disease, papular and nodular mucinosis in connective tissue diseases, self-healing
            cutaneous mucinosis, cutaneous focal mucinosis and myxoid cyst, while the latter include Pinkus follicular
            mucinosis and urticaria-like follicular mucinosis. Systemic manifestations associated with mucinoses include
            monoclonal gammopathies in scleromyxoedema and scleredema, diabetes</p>

            characterized by lichenoid papules, nodules and/or plaques due to abnormal dermal mucin deposition and a
            variable degree of fi brosis and fi broblast proliferation in the absence of thyroid disease. Two
            clinicopathological subsets are included: (i) a generalized papular and sclerodermoid form (also called
            scleromyxoedema of Arndt-Gottron) with a monoclonal gammopathy and systemic, sometimes lethal,
            manifestations; and (ii) a localized papular form which does not have systemic implications. Occasionally,
            patients with LM have overlapping or atypical features and fall between scleromyxoedema and localized LM
            (Table 59.1 ) [ ]. 1</p>

            trunk and thighs (Figures 59.2, 59.3 and 59.4) [ 1 ,2 ]. Papules often are arranged in a strikingly linear

            longitudinal folding that gives the appearance of a leonine face (Figure 59.5 ). Deep furrowing is also
            evident on the trunk, shoulders and limbs (Shar-Pei sign) (Figure 59.6 ). Erythema, oedema and a brownish
            discoloration may be seen in the involved areas; itching is not uncommon. Eyebrow, axillary and pubic hair
            may be sparse. Mucosal lesions are absent. As the condition progresses, erythematous and infi ltrated
            plaques develop with skin stiffening, sclerodactyly and reduced mobility of the mouth and the joints of the
            hands, arms and legs. Over the proximal interphalangeal joints, a central depression surrounded by an
            elevated rim (due to the skin thickening) is referred to as the 'doughnut sign' (Figure 59.7 ).
            Telangiectasia and calcinosis are lacking but Raynaud phenomenon may rarely occur.</p>

        <p>The prognosis of scleromyxoedema is variable. Scleromyxoedema follows a chronic, progressive and sometimes
            unpredictable course [ 2 . Involvement of the central nervous system, heart, kidney or pro-] gression to
            overt myeloma worsens the prognosis. The main causes of death include dermatoneuro syndrome (scleromyxoedema
            with concomitant fever, convulsions and coma), cardiovascular complications and haematological malignancies
            [ 2 . Septic complications ] are mostly linked to melphalan therapy that is now less commonly used [ 13 ].
            In a recent case series, fi ve (23.8%) of 21 patients had died, whereas 12 were alive with disease and four
            alive without disease after a mean follow-up period of 33.5 months [ 2 . ]</p>

            59.2 ). Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (alone or in combination with other drugs) has gained widespread
            acceptance as the fi rst line therapy for both skin involvement and extracutaneous manifestations, and
            especially for acute deterioration of the clinical condition with neurological symptoms [ , 21-22 ].
            Although remissions persisting for a few 2 months to 3 years after cessation of intravenous immunoglobulin
            infusions have been reported, the response is not permanent and maintenance infusions spaced out to every
            6-8 weeks are required [ 23 ]. Thalidomide (or lenalidomide) and/or systemic steroids are considered the
            second line of treatment, more often in combination with intravenous immunoglobulins than as monotherapy [
            24-28 ]. Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation can be considered as a third line of
            treatment [ 29 ]. The association of bortezomib and dexamethasone targeting plasma cell dyscrasia has been
            suggested for recurrences after autologous stem cell transplantation and also for dermatoneuro syndrome [

        <p>n localized LM, patients have small fi rm waxy papules (or nodI ules and plaques produced by the confl uence
            of papules) confi ned to only a few sites. There are no sclerotic features, no paraproteinaemia, no systemic
            involvement and no association with thyroid disease. Localized LM is classifi ed into four subtypes: (i)
            acral persistent papular mucinosis; (ii) discrete papular lichen myxoedmatosus; (iii) cutaneous (papular)
            mucinosis of infancy; and (iv) nodular lichen myxoedmatosus [ 1 ].</p>
        <h2>pidemiology E</h2>
        <p>The exact incidence and prevalence rates of the variants of localized LM are unknown as they are rare
            diseases. Both sexes are equally affected in discrete papular LM. A female predominance (female : male ratio
            of 3 : 1) has been noted in acral persistent papular mucinosis.</p>
        <h2>athology P</h2>
        <p>n localized LM, the histological changes are less characteristic I than in scleromyxoedema. Mucin accumulates
            in the upper and mid reticular dermis, fi broblast proliferation is variable and fi brosis is not marked and
            may even be absent. In acral persistent papular mucinosis, mucin accumulates focally in the upper reticular
            dermis (sparing a subepidermal zone) and fi broblasts are not increased in number (Figure 59.8 a, b). In
            cutaneous mucinosis of infancy, the mucin may be so superfi cial as to look as if it were 'enclosed' by
            epidermis [ 1 , 8 ] but mucin deposition may also occur in the reticular dermis.</p>

        <h2>Disease course and prognosis</h2>
        <p>Localized lichen myxoedematosus in all its variants runs a chronic but benign course in the absence of
            systemic involvement. Progression to scleromyxoedema has never been proven.</p>
        <h2>Management</h2>
        <p>Localized LM is a benign condition that often does not require any therapy (a 'wait and see' approach). Many
            treatments have been tried including dermabrasion, CO2 laser, electrocoagulation, topical and intralesional
            corticosteroids or hyaluronidase injections, oral retinoids and psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA) with variable
            results. Topical calcineurin inhibitors [ 40 ] may be of some benefi t. However, spontaneous resolution may
            occur, even in the setting of HIV-associated cases [ 41 ].</p>
        <h2>Reticular erythematous mucinosis</h2>
        <h2>Defi nition and nomenclature</h2>
        <p>Reticular erythematous mucinosis is a rare, chronic primary cutaneous mucinosis characterized by a
            persistent reticular macular erythema or erythematous papules and plaques in the midline of the back or
            chest.</p>

            <li>• Midline mucinosis</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Epidemiology</h2>
        <p>Reticular erythematous mucinosis is a rare disease that has been described worldwide in patients with
            different ethnic backgrounds. It affects predominantly middle-aged women, although men and children are not
            spared [ ]. 1</p>
        <h2>Associated diseases</h2>
        <p>In general, REM is not related to systemic diseases. However, certain disorders, especially malignancies
            (e.g. haematological, breast, lung, colon) and thyroid dysfunction have been sometimes associated [ 1 2 , .
            Autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus ] erythematosus, diabetes, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
            and also HIV infection have been anecdotally reported in patients with REM [ ]. 2</p>
        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
        <p>The aetiopathogenesis is unclear. Viral diseases and immunological disturbances have been implicated. The fi
            broblasts of patients with REM exhibit an abnormal response to stimulation by exogenous interleukin [ 3 ].
        </p>
        <h2>Predisposing factors</h2>
        <p>Although REM has been considered a photoaggravated disorder, the role of sunlight is actually controversial [
            1 . ] Oral contraceptives, pregnancy, menses, heat, X-ray therapy and perspiration have been also implicated
            to promote or exacerbate REM [ 2 . Familial cases suggesting a genetic predisposition have been ] reported [
            ]. 4</p>
        <h2>Pathology</h2>
        <p>Interstitial deposits of mucin are seen in the upper dermis, along with a perivascular and, at times,
            perifollicular T-cell infi ltrate with variable deep perivascular extension. There is slight vascular
            dilatation. The epidermis is typically normal. Usually, direct immunofl uorescence is negative, but, rarely,
            granular deposits of immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin A and C3 have been seen at the dermal-epidermal
            junction [ 5 . ]</p>
        <h2>Clinical features</h2>
        <p>Reticular erythematous mucinosis is characterized by erythematous macules and indurated papules or
            plaque-like lesions with a reticular confi guration and lack of scale or other surface changes in the
            midline of the chest (Figure 59.11 ) or back. Atypical areas such as the arms, abdomen, face and legs are
            occasionally involved. The lesions are occasionally pruritic.</p>

        </figure>
        <h2>Differential diagnosis</h2>
        <p>There may be signifi cant overlap between REM and lupus erythematosus tumidus. Both conditions show clinical
            and histological similarities, lack immune serological abnormalities, respond well to antimalarials and
            resolve without residual lesions. However, patients with lupus tumidus who do not exhibit
            reticulate-patterned lesions on the midline, are strongly photosensitive, have a higher rate of immune
            reactants on direct immunofl uorescence, have a higher tendency to recur and occasionally present with other
            clinical manifestations of lupus [ 6 ]. Seborrhoeic dermatitis and pityriasis versicolor involve the central
            chest, but they have associated scale and different colour, as has confl uent and reticulated papillomatosis
            of Gougerot-Carteaud.</p>
        <h2>Disease course and prognosis</h2>
        <p>Reticular erythematous mucinosis is a chronic disease that, if untreated, has a prolonged duration. The
            lesions may clear spontaneously, even after 15 years.</p>
        <h2>nvestigations I</h2>
        <p>n general, REM is not associated with abnormal laboratory I tests.</p>
        <h2>Management</h2>
        <p>Antimalarials (e.g. hydroxychloroquine) are the fi rst line of treatment and they generally result in
            improvement or healing of the lesions within 1-2 months [ 7 ]. Relapses are not uncommon. Results from other
            therapies such as topical and systemic corticosteroids, topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, oral
            antihistamines, tetracycline, ciclosporin and pulsed dye laser are quite variable [ 2 8,9 ]. Despite the
            potential for an exacerbation, , successful results with UVB and UVA1 irradiation have been reported [ 10,11
            ].</p>

        <h2>ntroduction and general description I</h2>
        <p>Scleredema is a rare condition characterized by a non-pitting induration of the upper part of the body,
            associated with diabetes or with a history of infection or blood dyscrasia [ ]. 1</p>
        <h2>Epidemiology</h2>
        <p>Scleredema is rare and occurs in patients of all ages and ethnic backgrounds. The age distribution varies
            with the different subtypes. Among patients with diabetes, scleredema has been diagnosed in 2.5-14%. The
            form that is associated with diabetes is more prevalent in men (10 : 1), while other forms are seen more
            commonly in women (2 : 1) [ 2,3 ].</p>
        <h2>Associated diseases</h2>
        <p>Scleredema can be divided into a diabetic and non-diabetic type (see Box 59.1). The former is considered the
            most common type accounting for 25-50% of cases. It occurs mainly in obese middleaged men with poorly
            controlled insulin-dependent diabetes [ 3,4 ]. The non-diabetic form includes an idiopathic type; a
            post-infective type with acute onset, usually following a streptococcal upper respiratory infection but also
            infl uenza, measles, mumps, chickenpox, cytomegalovirus, diphtheria, encephalitis and dental abscesses; a
            monoclonal gammopathy-associated type; and a type associated with anecdotal miscellaneous conditions such as
            autoimmune disorders (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, Sjögren syndrome,
            dermatomyositis, anaphylactoid purpura), internal malignancies (malignant insulinoma, gallbladder carcinoma,
            carcinoid tumour, pituitary-adrenocortical neoplasms), exposure to organic solvents and HIV infection [ 2 ,
            5 , 6 ].</p>
        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
        <p>The pathogenesis is unknown. An increase of type 1 collagen synthesis by dysfunctional fi broblasts has been
            demonstrated in the affected skin. In diabetic scleredema, the accumulation of collagen may be due to
            irreversible non-enzymatic glycosylation of collagen and resistance to degradation by collagenase.
            Alternatively, excess stimulation by insulin, microvascular damage and hypoxia may induce the abnormal
            synthesis of collagen and mucin. Streptococcal hypersensitivity, injury to lymphatics and paraproteinaemia
            may also play a role.</p>
        <h2>Pathology</h2>
        <p>The epidermis is not involved. The dermis is 3-4 times thicker than normal. The collagen fi bres appear
            swollen and are separated by wide spaces. Acid mucopolysaccharides are found in the fenestrated spaces with
            special stains. However, negative staining does not exclude the diagnosis. The subcutaneous tissue is also
            involved with fat being replaced by coarse collagen fi bres. A slight perivascular lymphocytic infi ltrate
            may be seen but it is uncommon [ 7 ]. Fibroblast proliferation is absent. Mucin also accumulates in skeletal
            muscle and the heart.</p>
        <h2>Clinical features</h2>
        <p>Scleredema is characterized by fi rm non-pitting oedema and induration that typically begin on the posterior
            neck and spread to the upper back (Figure 59.12 ), shoulders and scalp. Erythema and a peau d'orange
            appearance of the skin are commonly observed. The hands and feet are characteristically spared. Unusual
            cases with limited site involvement have been reported [ 8 ]. Depending on the involved sites, patients
            often</p>

            in mastication and articulation.</p>
        <h2>Differential diagnosis</h2>
        <p>n contrast to systemic sclerosis, scleredema is not associated I with sclerodactyly, Raynaud phenomenon, nail
            fold capillary changes or serum autoantibodies. Additional differential diagnoses include myxoedema,
            amyloidosis, lymphoedema, cellulitis, dermatomyositis, trichinosis and oedema of cardiac or renal origin.
        </p>
        <h2>Complications and co-morbidities</h2>
        <p>Systemic involvement in scleredema is not frequent. Extracutaneous complications (in all forms) include
            serositis, dysarthria, dysphagia, myositis, parotitis, hepatosplenomegaly and ocular and cardiac
            abnormalities [ 9 ].</p>
        <h2>Disease course and prognosis</h2>
        <p>Prognosis is largely dependent on the underlying aetiology. Postinfectious scleredema runs a benign course
            because it is self-limiting in duration and resolves spontaneously within 6 months to 2 years. Scleredema
            associated with diabetes or monoclonal gammopathy runs a chronic and disabling course with little tendency
            to remission. Rarely death may occur when internal organs are involved.</p>
        <h2>nvestigations I</h2>
        <p>Laboratory investigations are useful for detecting an underlying disorder. A recent infection should be
            excluded (with throat swab culture and antistreptolysin titres). Fasting blood glucose or glycosylated
            haemoglobin measurements and serum protein electrophoresis and immunofi xation should be obtained.
            Ultrasonography can be performed to evaluate skin thickness at baseline and after treatment while magnetic
            resonance imaging may be useful for determining the extent of disease progression due to better soft-tissue
            contrast than ultrasound evaluation [ 10 ].</p>
        <h2>Management</h2>
        <p>The therapy of scleredema is quite difficult and has limited success. At present, no effective treatment is
            known for this disease. For patients with disabling manifestations, initial treatment with phototherapy is
            suggested as first choice (grade of recommendation: weak). UVA1, PUVA and narrow-band UVB have all been
            found to be effective [ 11 , 12 . Therapy is unneces-] sary for scleroderma associated with streptococcal
            infections because it resolves spontaneously. In patients with associated conditions, the disorder can
            resolve or improve if treatment of the primary disease is successful. In patients with scleredema-associated
            multiple myeloma, therapy targeting the plasma cell dyscrasia such as bortezomib may be effective [ 13 . ]
            Some but not all patients with diabetes-associated scleredema appear to improve with better glucose control.
            Other therapies that have been tried, with reduced patient numbers and overall limited success, include
            immunosuppressive agents</p>
        <p>such as ciclosporin A and methotrexate, high-dose penicillin, corticosteroids (local, intralesional and
            systemic), tamoxifen and allopurinol [ 14 ]. Electron-beam radiotherapy and extracorporeal photopheresis may
            also give some improvement [ 15-16 ]. Intravenous immunoglobulin seems to be a promising therapy [ 17
            ]. Patients with motion or respiratory disability should be referred to a physical therapist for
            musculoskeletal rehabilitation.</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Epidemiology</h2>
        <h2>ncidence and prevalence I</h2>
        <p>Localized (pretibial) myxoedema is found in 1-5% of patients with Graves disease, but in up to 25% of
            patients who have exophthalmus. Women are affected more often than men (3 : 1) with a peak of incidence at
            age 50-60 years [ 2 ].</p>
        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
        <p>The demonstration of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor protein expression by normal dermal fi broblasts
            suggests that thyroidstimulating hormone receptor antibodies may stimulate the production of mucin from
            these cells. Some cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor α and γ interferon secreted by T helper 1
            lymphocytes activated by thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antigen could also induce glycosaminoglycan
            synthesis from fi broblasts. Fibroblasts from the dermis of the lower extremities have been found to be more
            sensitive to this factor than are fi broblasts from other areas of the body [ 2 3-5 ]. Insulin-like , growth
            factor 1 receptor antibodies, trauma, tobacco and lymphatic obstruction may also play a role.</p>
        <h2>Pathology</h2>
        <p>Histopathology reveals hyperkeratosis with follicular plugging, acanthosis and sometimes papillomatosis. The
            reticular dermis, particularly the mid to the lower part, shows separation of collagen bundles by large
            quantities of mucin. A perivascular lymphocytic infi ltrate and an increase in mast cells may be found with
            normal or increased number of fi broblasts. Elastic fi bres are reduced in number [ 2 . ]</p>
        <h2>Clinical features</h2>
        <p>Pretibial myxoedema is one of the signs of Graves disease (along with goitre, exophthalmus, thyroid
            acropathy, and high circulating levels of long-acting thyroid-stimulating hormone). Less commonly, it has
            been described with Hashimoto thyroiditis and in patients with no past or present history of thyroid
            dysfunction. It is characterized by bilateral thickening and induration of the skin on the shins and dorsa
            of the feet. There are four main clinical variants: diffuse non-pitting oedema (43%) (Figure 59.13 ); plaque
            type (27%); nodular (18%) (Figure 59.14 ); and elephantiasis (5%)</p>

        <h2>Disease course and prognosis</h2>
        <p>Apart from the appearance, associated morbidity is usually not severe, except for patients with elephantiasis
            who are less likely to have remission. Entrapment of peroneal nerves by mucinous connective tissue may cause
            foot drop or faulty dorsifl exion.</p>
        <h2>nvestigations I</h2>
        <p>Thyroid-stimulating hormone is abnormally low and long-acting thyroid stimulator antibodies are elevated in
            50% of patients with Graves disease.</p>
        <h2>Management</h2>
        <p>The initial treatment includes minimizing risk factors, such as reducing weight, reducing tobacco use and
            normalizing thyroid function. However, therapy for the associated hyperthyroidism does not improve the
            cutaneous lesions and, often, localized myxoedema develops after treatment has been instituted. Severe
            myxoedema is most often encountered in patients with longstanding untreated Graves thyroid disease. The fi
            rst line of pharmacological therapy is medium to high potency topical</p>
        <p>corticosteroids applied under occlusive dressings or delivered by intralesional injection (grade of
            recommendation: weak) [ 2 ,9 , 10 ]. For the severe elephantiasic form, rituximab, plasmapheresis,
            intravenous immunoglobulins and octreotide with and without surgical shave removal have been tried with some
            benefi t in uncontrolled case reports [ 11-13 ]. Usually, skin grafting is followed by relapse. The use of
            compression stockings and gradient pneumatic compression is useful as it improves lymphedema. Localized
            myxoedema may clear spontaneously (on average after 3.5 years) [ 14 . ]</p>

        <p>A distinctive cutaneous mucinosis characterized by skin-coloured papules, nodules (Figure 59.17 a) and
            plaque-like lesions on the trunk and upper extremities may accompany or even antedate a connective tissue
            disease, mostly lupus erythematosus (cutaneous lupus mucinosis) and rarely dermatomyositis or scleroderma [
            1 . ]</p>
        <h2>Epidemiology</h2>
        <p>Cutaneous lupus mucinosis occurs in 1.5% of patients with lupus erythematosus in the fourth and fi fth
            decades of life, with a predominance of adult males in Asian patients and females in Caucasian cases [ 2 ].
        </p>
        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
        <p>The pathogenesis is unknown but increased glycosaminoglycan production by dermal fi broblasts stimulated by
            some cytokines or immunoglobulins, or an abnormal immune response linked to human leukocyte antigens HLAB8
            and HLADR3 haplotypes have been suggested [ 1,2 ].</p>
        <h2>Pathology</h2>

            seen on direct immunofl uorescence [ ,2 ]. 1</p>
        <h2>Clinical features</h2>
        <p>The clinical course may or may not be related to the underlying connective tissue disease activity. Usually,
            patients with lupus erythematosus who develop papular and nodular mucinosis have systemic disease in about
            75% of cases, but discoid and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus may also be associated with it.
            Periorbital mucinosis is an unusual presentation [ 3 ]. Cutaneous mucinosis in dermatomyositis usually
            follows the myositis and is characterized by erythematous nodules and plaque-like lesions on the trunk [ 4
            ]. The development of papular and nodular mucinosis has also been associated with scleroderma both the
            systemic and the cutaneous form [ 5 ].</p>
        <h2>Management</h2>
        <p>Therapy of papular and nodular mucinosis is the same as for the connective tissue disease. However, the
            evolution of the mucinoses does not always follow the course of the underlying disease. Sunscreens, topical
            or intralesional corticosteroids, and oral antimalarials can be effective in cutaneous lupus mucinosis.
            Systemic corticosteroids and oral tacrolimus are used for resistant cases [ ]. 6</p>

        <h2>ntroduction and general description I</h2>
        <p>Self-healing juvenile cutaneous mucinosis is a rare disease of unknown aetiology occurring in young people
            (from 13 months to 15 years of age) characterized by transient cutaneous lesions and sometimes mild infl
            ammatory symptoms [ 1 ].</p>
        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
        <p>Abnormal mucin production and fi broblast proliferation are suggested to be secondary to a reactive or
            reparative response to chronic antigenic stimulation, as can occur in viral infection or infl ammation.</p>
        <h2>Pathology</h2>
        <p>Histologically, papular lesions show mucin deposition with mild infl ammation and a small increase in fi
            broblasts while nodules show deep mucinous areas associated with bands of fi brosis, multiple capillaries,
            fi broblastic proliferation and gangliocyte-like giant cells in the subcutis consistent with nodular or
            proliferative fasciitis [ 2 . ]</p>
        <h2>Clinical features</h2>
        <p>Self-healing cutaneous mucinosis is characterized by the following criteria: (i) acute eruption of multiple
            papules, sometimes in linear infi ltrated plaques, on the face, neck, scalp, abdomen and thighs; (ii)
            mucinous subcutaneous nodules on the face with periorbital swelling and on periarticular areas of the limbs
            which sometimes are the predominant lesions (Figure 59.18 ); (iii) systemic symptoms such as fever,
            arthralgias, weakness and muscle tenderness in the absence of paraproteinaemia, bone marrow plasmocytosis
            and thyroid dysfunction; and (iv) spontaneous resolution in a period ranging from a few weeks to many months
            (usually from 2 to 8) [ 1 . It has also been described ] in adults [ 3 ].</p>
        <h2>Management</h2>
        <p>Despite the worrying presentation, the disease heals spontaneously and aggressive therapy should be avoided.

        <h2>athophsiology P</h2>

        <h2>Pathology</h2>
        <p>The histology is essential for diagnosis and shows a diffuse ill-defi ned dermal accumulation of mucin,
            sparing subcutaneous tissue, with normal or slight increase of fi broblasts and absence of infl ammation [ ,
            1 2 ]. Spindle-shaped fi broblasts are the predominant cell type, with occasional admixed factor
            XIIIa-positive dendritic cells. The epidermis may be normal or hyperplastic, sometimes forming a collarette.
            Additionally, absence of elastic fi bres without increased vascularity is seen.</p>

            to the joints of the hands, wrists or feet [ ]. Occasionally, cutaneous focal muci1 nosis has been reported
            as a soft fibroma-like polyp or a plaque-like lesion [ 2,3 ]. Multiple lesions have been rarely described [
            4 ].</p>
        <h2>Differential diagnosis</h2>
        <p>The main differential diagnosis is with angiomyxoma, a benign neoplasm which is larger (size over 1 cm), and
            shows subcutaneous involvement by mucin and increased vascularity [ 5 ].</p>
        <h2>Complications and co-morbidities</h2>
        <p>Contrary to other forms of primary mucinoses, cutaneous focal mucinosis is not usually related to systemic
            manifestations. Anecdotal associations with hypothyroidism and myxoedema or other forms of mucinoses such as
            scleromyxoedema and REM, and with antitumour necrosis factor α therapy, have been described [ 4 , 6 ].</p>

        <p>Surgical excision is the treatment of choice and relapse is uncommon.</p>
        <h2>Digital myxoid (mucous) cyst</h2>
        <h2>Defi nition</h2>
        <p>Digital myxoid cyst is a benign ganglion cyst of the digits.</p>
        <h2>Epidemiology</h2>
        <p>Women are affected more than twice as often as men.</p>
        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
        <p>There are two varieties of lesion: ganglion type derived from joint fluid and synovial cells, which is
            located over the joints; and myxomatous type, derived from dermal-based fi broblasts, which is located
            between the interphalangeal joints.</p>
        <h2>Pathology</h2>
        <p>Histopathological features show a large deposit of mucin-containing stellate fi broblasts, some vascular
            spaces and multiple clefts. The overlying epidermis is acanthotic laterally and more atrophic centrally.
            Transepidermal elimination of mucoid material may be seen.</p>
        <h2>Clinical features</h2>
        <p>It is a translucent dome-shaped soft or fl uctuant 3-10 mm nodule with or without visible semi-transparent
            contents located on the dorsal skin on or near a distal interphalangeal joint of the fi nger in middle-aged
            patients (Figure 59.20 ) [ 1 . Cysts may also ] be found on the toes. The surface may be smooth or
            verrucous. Subungual and multiple forms have been reported [ 2 ]. Clinical and radiographic evidence of
            osteoarthritis is common. Grooving of the nail may associate or even precede the cyst itself by up to 6
            months [ 3 ]. Antecedent trauma has been documented in a small minority of cases. A connection of the
            ganglion cyst to the underlying joint can be shown by means of magnetic resonance imaging [ 4 ]. Puncture or
            biopsy results in the drainage of viscous mucin from the cyst.</p>
        <h2>Management</h2>
        <p>None of the existing treatments is consistently successful. Digital myxoid cyst can be excised but relapse is
            not uncommon and many dermatologists tend to favor more conservative treatments such as multiple needling or
            aspiration followed by steroid injection, sclerosant injection, cryotherapy, infrared coagulation or CO 2
            laser [ 5 ].</p>
        <h2>OLLICULAR MUCINOSES F</h2>
        <p>Mucin accumulates in the epithelial hair follicle sheaths and sebaceous glands in two primary (idiopathic)
            distinctive clinical disorders: Pinkus follicular mucinosis and urticaria-like follicular mucinosis [ 1 ].
            Follicular mucinosis can also occur as a histological epiphenomenon most often seen in cutaneous T-cell
            lymphomas (see Chapter 140) and other skin diseases [ 2 ].</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
        <p>It is far from clear why dermal-type mucin is deposited selectively within an epithelial structure. Although
            follicular keratinocytes have been considered to be the source of the mucin, an aetiological role for
            cell-mediated immune mechanisms has been proposed. A reaction to persistent antigens such as Staphylococcus
            aureus has also been considered [ 1 ]. Familial cases suggest a genetic predisposition [ 3 ].</p>
        <h2>Pathology</h2>
        <p>Mucin accumulates within the follicular epithelium and sebaceous glands causing keratinocytes to disconnect
            from each other (Figure 59.21 c, d). In more advanced lesions, the follicles are converted into cystic
            spaces containing mucin, infl ammatory cells and altered keratinocytes. A perifollicular infi ltrate of
            lymphocytes, histiocytes and eosinophils is seen. The differentiation between Pinkus follicular mucinosis
            and mycosis fungoides-associated follicular mucinosis is very diffi cult and there is no single reliable
            criterion. Although the existence of primary follicular mucinosis has been questioned, as it has been
            considered as an 'indolent' localized form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, clues in favour of a primary form
            are the young age of the patient, a solitary lesion on the head or neck and the absence of histological
            features of epidermotropism or atypical lymphocytes [ 4 5 , . Clonal T-cell rearrange-] ment is not always
            useful to differentiate the two types. In these cases, clinical follow-up is mandatory.</p>
        <h2>Clinical features</h2>
        <p>Pinkus follicular mucinosis presents as an acute or subacute eruption characterized by one or several sharply
            demarcated erythematous plaques with follicular prominence (Figure 59.21 a), scaling and alopecia (Figure
            59.21 b) [ 1 , 5 ]. Nodules, annular plaques, folliculitis, follicular spines, acneform eruptions and
            alopecia areata-like presentation [ 6 ] have also been described. A second type which is characterized by a
            more generalized chronic form in a slightly older age group, with larger and more numerous plaques on the
            extremities, trunk and face, is probably best regarded as a follicular mucinosis associated with cutaneous
            T-cell lymphoma rather than a primary condition.</p>
        <h2>Management</h2>
        <p>There is no specifi c treatment for Pinkus follicular mucinosis [ 3 ]. A wait and see approach should be
            considered as many cases heal spontaneously in 2-24 months. Topical, intralesional and systemic
            corticosteroids, topical retinoids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical bexarotene, imiquimod, dapsone,
            antimalarials, indometacin, minocycline, oral isotretinoin, interferon α -2b, photodynamic therapy and UVA1
            phototherapy have been reported to be of benefi t on an anecdotal basis [ 7-9 ].</p>

            epithelium and sebaceous glands causing keratinocytes to disconnect. (d) Follicular mucin stained with
            Alcian blue.</p>
        <h2>Pathology</h2>
        <p>On histopathological examination urticaria-like follicular mucinosis presents with mucin deposition inside
            the hair follicles associated with a perivascular and perifollicular infi ltrate of ymphocytes and
            eosinophils. Rearrangement of T-cell receptors l is more frequently polyclonal and it is not decisive in the
            differential diagnosis.</p>
        <h2>Clinical features</h2>
        <p>Urticaria-like follicular mucinosis presents with recurrent pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of the
            face and neck on a</p>
        <p>'rosaceiform or seborrhoeic' background. As lesions resolve, red macules persist for a few weeks.
            Hair-bearing regions may be involved, but neither follicular plugging nor alopecia is seen. The diagnosis is
            usually delayed since the dermatitis is often misinterpreted as urticaria, seborrhoeic dermatitis, rosacea
            or lupus tumidus before a biopsy is taken.</p>
        <h2>Management</h2>
        <p>Urticaria-like follicular mucinosis has a good prognosis although it may last up to 15 years. Therapy is
            diffi cult. Antimalarials and dapsone have been reported as benefi cial [ 10 ].</p>
        <h2>ECONDARY MUCINOSES S</h2>
        <p>Secondary cutaneous mucinoses include all those entities in which mucin deposition simply represents an
            additional histological finding and not the main feature (see Box 59.1) [ 1 ].</p>
