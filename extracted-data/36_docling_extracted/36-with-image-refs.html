<h2>Defi  nition and nomenclature</h2>
<p>Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is the name given to a group of clinically similar papulosquamous dermatoses, the underlying pathogenesis  of  which  is  only  just  beginning  to  be  unravelled.  They initially  present  with  erythematous  hyperkeratotic  perifollicular papules which tend to coalesce into plaques but may progress to erythroderma, particularly in adults. The distribution, age of onset and speed of onset differ markedly between patients and these differences have been used to classify PRP into a number of clinically distinct subtypes.</p>

<li>•    Keratosis circumscripta</li>
</ul>
<h2>ntroduction and general description I</h2>
<p>Pityriasis  rubra  pilaris  is  a  papulosquamous  dermatosis  of unknown cause. PRP was first described by Claudius Tarral in 1828 and given its present name by Besnier in 1889 [  1  ]. It has been divided into five clinical types by Griffiths [  2  ] and a sixth type related to HIV infection has been described more recently [  3  . ]</p>

<h2>pidemiology E</h2>
<h2>ncidence and prevalence I</h2>
<p>Pityriasis rubra pilaris is an uncommon condition which was estimated to occur in less than 1 in 5000 patients presenting to a large dermatology centre in the UK [ 4 . ]</p>
<h2>Age</h2>
<p>The  rare  familial  form  of  PRP  starts  in  early  childhood.  The acquired forms of PRP have a bimodal age distribution with peaks in the fi  rst and fi  fth decades [    ]. 4</p>
<h2>ex S</h2>
<p>t shows an equal sex incidence. I</p>
<h2>thnicity E</h2>
<p>t shows no racial predilection. I</p>
<h2>Associated diseases</h2>
<p>Although there have been a number of case reports of PRP in association with a variety of solid tumours including carcinoma of the larynx, colon, kidney and lung [  5,6  ], PRP is not generally thought to be associated with an increased incidence of malignancy.</p>
<p>Pityriasis  rubra  pilaris  has  been  described  in  association  with various  autoimmune  diseases  including  systemic  sclerosis  and autoimmune thyroiditis [  7-9  ], though the paucity of such reports suggests that a causal link is unlikely.</p>

<h2>athophysiology P</h2>
<p>The pathogenesis of PRP is unknown. The rare genetic form has been  linked  in  some  pedigrees  to  gain-of-function  mutations in the CARD14 gene, an activator of nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFκ B) [ 10 . Such mutations ] appear to be rare in sporadic forms of PRP [ 11 .  Streptococcal ] superantigens have been implicated in children with sporadic forms of PRP [  12,13  ].  PRP  has  also  been  associated  with  HIV infection [  3  ].</p>
<h2>Pathology</h2>
<p>The  histological  features  of  PRP  are  not  pathognomonic  and change with the evolution of the disease. They do, however, allow discrimination from psoriasis and other causes of erythroderma.</p>
<p>The  skin  shows  hyperkeratosis  with  follicular  plugging. Ortho- and parakeratosis may alternate in the skin and the follicles may show foci of parakeratosis in the perifollicular shoulder. There may be patchy or confl  uent hypergranulosis. Dermal capillaries are dilated but are not tortuous as seen in psoriasis. Acantholysis may be present, often restricted to adnexal epithelium [  14  ]. There is a sparse lymphocytic dermal infi  ltrate but no neutrophils (Figure   36.1  ).</p>
<h2>Genetics</h2>
<p>The familial  form  of  PRP  is  inherited  as  an  autosomal  dominant trait. Recent studies have mapped PRP to 17q25.3 which overlaps  with  the  PSOR2  susceptibility  locus  for  psoriasis. Using candidate gene screening, investigators have identifi  ed heterozygous  gene  mutations  in CARD14 which  encodes  the caspase recruitment domain family, member 14. CARD14 is an activator of NF κ B signalling, which is implicated in infl  ammatory diseases [ 10 . ]</p>

<h2>Clinical features</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The more common generalized sporadic forms (types I and III) tend to have an acute onset. The rare familial form of PRP (type V, see later) generally has a slow and gradual onset.</p>
<h2>resentation P</h2>
<p>Patients typically present with well-defi  ned salmon-red or orangered  dry  scaly  plaques,  which  may  coalesce  and  become  widespread. Typically islands of normal skin are present, the so-called 'islands of sparing'. The disease often starts on the scalp before spreading  down  over  the  rest  of  the  body.  Some  patients  may become erythrodermic. Pruritus may be present in the early stages of the disease.</p>
<p>On the elbows, wrists and the backs of the fi  ngers, characteristic follicular  hyperkeratosis may be present - 'nutmeg grater' papules. Palms and soles may become thickened and fi  ssured with an orange discoloration. In type IV PRP, the disease is largely limited to the extremities.</p>
<h2>Clinical variants</h2>
<p>Six clinical variants have been described [  2,3  ].</p>
<h2>Classical adult-onset PRP (type I)</h2>
<p>This  is  the  most  common and recognizable form, representing some 50% of all cases. It affects the sexes equally with highest incidence between 40 and 60 years of age. The eruption usually starts without obvious precipitating factors as an erythematous slightly scaly macule on the head, neck or upper trunk. Further macules appear within a few weeks and at this stage the rash may be mistaken for seborrhoeic dermatitis. The true diagnosis becomes apparent with the appearance of a profusion of  erythematous  perifollicular  papules,  each  with  a  central  acuminate  keratotic  plug.  Follicular  lesions  are  initially  discrete  but then coalesce to form groups of two, three or more. Irritation is initially absent, but may be pronounced as the disease spreads (Figure   36.2  a).</p>
<p>nterfollicular erythema appears and the follicular lesions are I gradually  submerged  in  sheets  of  erythema  of  a  slight  orange hue, which typically spreads from the head to the feet. The face becomes uniformly erythematous and mild ectropion may follow (Figure   36.3  a). Prolonged erythema may give rise to peripheral oedema and, in the elderly, may precipitate high-output cardiac failure. The scalp shows diffuse bran-like scaling. Erythroderma frequently  develops  within  2-3  months  (see  Figure    36.2  a).  In most cases, sharply demarcated islands of unaffected skin 1 cm in diameter remain as a helpful diagnostic sign ('island of sparing'). Circumscribed islands of deeper erythema are also sometimes seen.</p>
<p>The palms and soles become hyperkeratotic and yellow (Figure 6.3  b-d). The nails are thickened and discoloured distally, show3 ing splinter haemorrhages, but unlike psoriasis there is no dystrophy of the nail plate and pitting is minimal [  15  ] (Figure   36.3  e).</p>
<p>Untreated,  type  I  PRP  does  eventually  resolve  in  an  average of 3 years in the majority of affected patients (see Disease course and prognosis).</p>

<h2>Atypical adult-onset PRP (type II)</h2>
<p>This is a much more chronic form, which may last many years. The scaling is rather more variable than in type I PRP: although perifollicular scale and palmoplantar keratoderma are both features, many patients show eczematous features and the keratoderma is coarser than in other types. The rapid progression of infl  ammation from the head down towards the feet as occurs in type I PRP does not occur and erythroderma is less common. It accounted for 5% of cases in a large series [    ]. 4</p>
<h2>Classical juvenile-onset PRP (type III)</h2>
<p>Type III is the most common childhood form of PRP and is considered to be the counterpart of type I PRP but with an onset between the ages of 5 and 10 years [  16  ] (Figure   36.2  b). This form of PRP usually undergoes spontaneous resolution in 1-2 years. Some patients with type III PRP may evolve into type IV PRP and vice versa [  16  ]. Recurrence of type III PRP in later adult life has been reported [  17  ].</p>
<h2>Circumscribed juvenile PRP (type IV)</h2>
<p>This type represented about 25% of cases of PRP in the series cited earlier [ 4 . It occurs in prepubertal children, usually under 12 years ] of age [  16  ].  Commonest features are well-circumscribed plaques of erythema and follicular hyperkeratosis occurring on the elbows and  knees  (Figures    36.2  c  and    36.4  a,b).  Scattered  erythematous scaly macules may be present on the trunk and scalp. Palmoplantar keratoderma may be observed (Figure   36.4  c-d). The prognosis of type IV PRP is uncertain but there have been reports of the disease remitting in teenage years.</p>
<h2>Atypical juvenile PRP (type V)</h2>
<p>This chronic childhood type accounted for a further 5% of cases [ 4 . ] Familial PRP is most often of this type, which may be genetically heterogeneous and may be diffi  cult to distinguish from ichthyoses and erthyrokeratoderma [  18  ]. Type V PRP may be present at birth or start in  early  childhood  with  erythema  and  hyperkeratosis.  Follicular hyperkeratosis is a prominent feature and keratoderma is common. Scleroderma-like changes have been described in the hands and feet.</p>
<h2>HIV-related PRP (type VI)</h2>
<p>This form of PRP became apparent with the onset of the HIV epidemic [  3  ,  19  ].  It  tends  to  resemble type I PRP and to be resistant to treatment. It may, however, respond to antiretroviral therapy. Spontaneous  remission  without  treatment  has  been  reported  in one patient after 2 years [  19  ]. Some patients develop elongated fi  liform keratoses on the face and trunk. An association with truncal conglobate acne has been noted [  3  ,  19  ].</p>
<h2>Differential diagnosis</h2>
<p>Dermatoses with erythema and follicular hyperkeratosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>•    Psoriasis (Table   36.1  ).</li>
<li>•    Erythrokeratoderma variabilis.</li>
<li>•    Sézary syndrome and other T-cell lymphomas.</li>
<li>•    Other forms of erythroderma.</li>
</ul>
<p>T ype IV  PRP  shares  many  clinical  features  with  keratosis circumscripta.</p>
<h2>Complications and co-morbidities</h2>
<p>Dependent  oedema  and  risk  of  high-output  cardiac  failure  in erythrodermic patients are well recognized.</p>
<h2>Disease course and prognosis</h2>
<p>Disease course and prognosis depends on the type of PRP. Classical  adult  PRP  (type  I)  may  progress  from  limited  disease  to erythroderma in a matter of weeks (Figure   36.5  a-d) but eventually clears spontaneously in the majority of affected patients [  2  ] (Figure   36.6  a-f). In a review of 46 patients seen before the era of systemic retinoids or biological agents, resolution was observed in  80%, of whom half had cleared by 3 years [  20  ]. Spontaneous</p>

<p>resolution after as long as 20 years has been reported [  21  ] but in some patients it may persist indefi  nitely [  2  ] (see Figures   36.5 and 6.6  ). Classical juvenile PRP (type III) typically runs a shorter course 3 with remission in an average of 1 year [  2  ]. Atypical PRP (types II and V) are chronic diseases but are usually more limited in extent than types I and III. The prognosis of circumscribed juvenile PRP (type IV) is uncertain but may last indefi  nitely (see Figure   36.4  ).</p>
<p>in which spontaneous resolution is the norm, claims of treatment success must be balanced against this. Patients who are erythrodermic may need intense supportive care to prevent hypothermia, electrolyte imbalance, protein loss and sepsis.</p>
<h2>nvestigations I</h2>
<p>Diagnosis is made on clinical features and supported by histology. No other tests are indicated.</p>
<h2>Management</h2>
<p>This is a rare disease for which there have been no large controlled trials of treatment interventions: recommendations are thus based on case reports, small series and retrospective reviews. In a disease n a review of 40 patients with PRP (36 with classical adult type I I disease), 14 showed a marked clinical improvement (≥75% reduction in baseline severity) without recourse to systemic or phototherapy. Only three patients appeared to derive benefi  t from various forms of phototherapy (partial response only). Nineteen patients received acitretin alone of whom fi  ve showed a marked and fi  ve a partial response.  Three  patients  were  reported  to  have  shown  marked responses to methotrexate (one in combination with acitretin) [ 22 ].</p>
<p>n  a  systematic review of the response of PRP type I to tumour I necrosis  factor  (TNF)  antagonists,  the  authors  felt  able  to  attribute either complete (     = 10) or partial ( n n =  1) responses to infl  iximab, adalimumab or etanercept in 11 of 15 eligible cases [ 23 . It should be noted ] that the majority of patients continued either acitretin or methotrexate when TNF antagonist therapy was introduced. Selective reporting bias is inherent in such an analysis but the review does suggest that these agents may be more effective than standard systemic therapy.</p>

<p>Several case reports of dramatic responses to the anti-interleukin (IL)  12/IL-23  antibody,  ustekinumab,  have  been  reported.  This agent suppresses activation of the NFκ B pathway, which is known to be overactive in individuals with familial PRP. Marked improvement within 4 weeks of commencing treatment has been reported in a patient with familial PRP in whom a CARD14 mutation was demonstrated [ 22 ]  and in several sporadic cases. It may be that this agent will become the agent of choice but further evidence of its effi  cacy in this disorder is needed.</p>
<p>Emollients should be applied liberally and form an important part  of  management  for  treating  dry  skin  and  restoring  barrier function  in  all  patients  with  PRP.  Topical  corticosteroids  may provide symptomatic relief in patients with pruritus but have no long-term effect on the course of PRP. Topical calcipotriol and topical tazarotene have both been advocated for type IV PRP but the evidence of effi  cacy is based on very small numbers [  29,30  ].</p>
<p>f  systemic  therapy  is  warranted,  acitretin  at  a  dose  of  up  to I 50 mg/day should be considered. Alternatively, methotrexate in</p>
