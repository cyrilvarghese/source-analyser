## Defi  nition

## PLAQUE PSORIASIS

erative conditions of the skin, associated with systemic manifestations in many organ systems. The most characteristic lesions consist  of  red,  scaly,  sharply  demarcated,  indurated  plaques, present  particularly  over  the  extensor  surfaces  and  scalp.  The extent  and  severity  varies  enormously  over  time  and  between individuals.  Morphological variants are common. Both genetic and environmental infl  uences have a critical role in the aetiology and pathogenesis.

Psoriasis  is  heterogeneous  in  its  morphology,  affected  sites, natural  history,  age  at  onset,  duration  and  precipitating  factors. Pending a full aetiological classifi  cation, Box 35.1 provides a provisional working classifi  cation suitable for diagnosis and patient management.

This  chapter  is  divided  into  three  sections:  plaque  psoriasis, pustular psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

## pidemiology E

## ncidence and prevalence I

The point prevalence rises during childhood, and in adults psoriasis affects approximately 2-3% of the population in Europe and the US [    ,  2  ]. There are wide variations in the reported prevalence 1 of  psoriasis  in  different  populations  ranging  between  0.91%  in the US to 8.5% in Norway [  2  ]. This may refl  ect variations in study methodology or ethnic and environmental differences between populations. The annual incidence in adults has been reported as between 0.08 and 0.23% [  2  ]. All the fi  gures above relate primarily to plaque psoriasis. Estimates of the disease variants are much less robust. These variants probably account for approximately 10% of all cases.

## Ethnicity

Psoriasis appears to be more common in countries that are further from the equator and in white people. It is rare in Native Americans [  3  and one study found 0% prevalence in Latin American Indians [  4  ]. ]

## Age at onset

There are two peak ages of incidence, the fi  rst occurring between 16 and 22 years and the second between 57 and 62 years of age. This  has  led  to  the  concept  of  type  I  and  type  II  psoriasis  (see later) [    ]. In 35% of patients, disease onset is before the age of 20 5 years and 58% before age 30 years. In a UK study, the mean age of onset was 33 years with the mode in the second decade. In 75% of patients, the disease onset was before 46 years of age [  6  ].

## Gender

Some studies have reported an earlier age of onset of psoriasis in girls although psoriasis affects adult women and men equally [  7-9  ]. Studies assessing the use of systemic and biological treatment in cohorts of patients with severe disease report consistently that men are twice as likely to receive systemic therapy as women, suggesting that men may have more severe disease [  10,11  ].

## athophysiology P

## Genetics

There  is  overwhelming  evidence  that  psoriasis  has  an  important genetic  component.  Lomholt's  classic  epidemiological  study  of psoriasis in the Faroe Islands, in which he examined more than 10  000 inhabitants, made the key observation that the prevalence of psoriasis was much greater amongst relatives of sufferers than controls [  ]. 1 A further large-scale Swedish study supported these data, showing the prevalence of psoriasis to be 7.8% in fi  rst-degree relatives compared with 3.1% in matched controls [  2  ]. Based on population data, lifetime risks of psoriasis are 4%, 28% and 65% if neither, one or both parents are affected [  3  ]. The bimodal peak in age at disease onset can be taken as evidence for the existence of two pathogenetically distinct forms of the disease, similar to the model for diabetes [ 4 . Thus, type ] I is hereditary, strongly HLA associated (particularly HLA-C:06:02), early onset and more likely to be severe. Type II is sporadic, HLA unrelated, of late onset and often mild. A study in Iceland has confirmed many of these data [  5  ]. Others, however, have suggested that the situation is more complex [  6  ], and certainly there are many individuals in extended family pedigrees with late-onset disease.

Support  for  these  population  studies  comes  from  analysis  of various family pedigrees in which psoriasis appears throughout multiple generations [  7  ]. While some have argued that the family data are most consistent with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with reduced penetrance, others have suggested that the best fi  t is a double recessive model. Most authors regard the data as consistent with a polygenic or multifactorial pattern. Interestingly, the development and severity of psoriasis may be infl  uenced by the sex of the contributing parent. Thus several studies have noted evidence for a preferential paternal effect, while one study further showed earlier age of onset when the disease was inherited from the father, consistent with 'genetic anticipation' [  8  ].

Perhaps the most robust data supporting a genetic basis to psoriasis come from studies examining concordance for the disease in twins. Examination of individuals from the Danish Twin Registry has shown concordance for psoriasis in 20% of monozygotic twins compared to 9% for dizygotic twins, corresponding to an estimated heritability of 68% [  9  ]. Similar heritability estimates were reported from Australian [  10  ] and Norwegian [  11  ] twin registers. When monozygotic twins are concordant for psoriasis, the age of onset, distribution of the disease and severity are very similar suggesting that genetic factors play a role in these parameters. However, concordance rates do not reach 100% even when older twins are examined, indicating that the environment plays a key role in disease expression. Based on the variable extent and pattern in which it is inherited through families, it is suggested that psoriasis represents a spectrum of genetic diseases. At one end are the rare families in which changes in a single gene may be suffi  cient to cause the disease. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the more common form in which an obvious family history may be lacking. In these individuals, it is likely that changes in multiple genes, interacting both with each other and the envir  onment are required for disease expression [  12  ].

All the above investigations have studied plaque psoriasis. Little is known of the genetic epidemiology of other forms. Guttate psoriasis is almost invariably HLA-C:06:02 associated [  13,14  ] and thought to be closely linked pathogenically to type I plaque psoriasis. The genetics of pustular psoriasis is discussed on p. 35.33  .

## Molecular genetics

Classical  genome-wide linkage analysis in pedigrees multiply affected by psoriasis has identifi  ed at least nine chromosomal

loci with statistically signifi  cant evidence for linkage ( PSORS1 -PSORS9 [ ) 1  ].  By  far the major psoriasis genetic determinant is PSORS1 which  probably  accounts  for  35-50%  of  the  known , heritability of the disease [  2  ], and has been replicated in virtually all linkage studies [  3  ]. PSORS1 is located within the major histocompatibility  complex  (MHC)  on  chromosome  6p,  spanning an approximately 300-kb segment within the class I region. Identifi  cation of the causative gene at this locus is hampered by the extensive linkage disequilibrium observed within the MHC. The consensus major risk allele at this site is HLA-C:06:02 but , there  may  be  additional  independent  associations  within  the MHC, for instance with MICA and MICB [  4,5  ]. Phenotypic variants  of  psoriasis  are  genetically  heterogeneous  at  the  level  of PSORS1 . Thus,  guttate  psoriasis  is  strongly  associated  with PSORS1 [ 6  ],  whereas late-onset (&gt;50 years of age) plaque psoriasis is not [  7  ].

CARD14 by exome sequencing in 2012 [ 8 ,9  ].  Heterozygous gainof-function  mutations  in CARD14 lead  to  nuclear  factor  kappa light  chain  enhancer  of  activated  B  cell  (NFκ B)  activation  in affected keratinocytes and consequent production of chemokines and recruitment of infl  ammatory cells.

Of particular interest is PSORS2 a replicated locus fi  rst mapped , to chromosome 17q in 1994 [  2  ] and fi  nally identifi  ed as the gene

The availability of large, well-characterized cohorts of psoriasis  patients  together  with  advances  in  high-throughput  genotyping at the genomic level have combined to permit disease case-control  association  studies  producing  robust  replicated data  on  associated  genes.  Several  genome-wide  association studies (GWAS) [  10-16  ] and meta-analyses of GWAS [  17,18  , 19 ] have now been reported and provide evidence for over 40 genes involved in disease causation (Table   35.1  ).  Interestingly,  these genes relate to a limited number of biological pathways, notably antigen presentation, T-cell (particularly Th17) differentiation, NF- B-regulated signalling and perturbation of the epidermal κ barrier  (see  Table    35.1  ).  Several  of  these  genes  overlap  with those  identifi  ed  as  being  associated  with  other  autoimmune

diseases (e.g. Crohn disease, ankylos  ing spondylitis and coeliac disease (CD)), particularly those involved in Th17 differentiation and interleukin (IL)-17 responsiveness (e.g. IL12B , IL23A , IL23R and TRAF3IP2 )  [ 20  ]. The relative risk of associated polymorphisms in these genes is low, making functional characterization of risk alleles diffi  cult, but in several instances there is evidence of additive association between genes (epistasis) for instance between HLA-C and ERAP1 [  16  ] and between HLA-C , LCE and IL 12B [  21  ].

The impact on the management of psoriasis of translating genetic information into the clinic is yet to be fully realized. Currently, too small a proportion of the heritability is accounted for by known loci for genotyping to contribute to the diagnosis, but rare genetic mutations of major effect (e.g. in CARD14 or IL36RN are  being ) identifi  ed that may be useful in subclassifying psoriatic diseases. As the genetic architecture of psoriasis is more fully understood, investigation of gene-environment interactions may suggest interventions that prevent or modify the natural history of psoriasis.

The most immediate consequence of a greater understanding of  the  genetic  basis  of  psoriasis  may  be  in  the  design  of  new drugs,  and  the  selection  and  monitoring  of  individual  treatments. Susceptibility loci may provide useful therapeutic targets. In this respect, the high effi  cacy of monoclonal antibodies targeting  the  IL-23/IL-17  axis  in  psoriasis  is  encouraging,  given  the only modest odds ratios (1.5) of risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at IL23R As more selective treatments emerge, the . likelihood of a differential responsiveness to treatment between patients depending on genotype will increase. Currently, there is suggestive evidence that polymorphisms in TNFAIP3 may be associated with response to tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α inhibitors [  22  ] and that patients who have the HLA-C risk allele may respond better to ustekinumab than those who are HLA-C:06:02 negative [  23,24  ]. Replication of these data is required.

## nvironmental factors E

## nfection I

An  association  between  tonsillitis  and  psoriasis  was  fi  rst  noted nearly 100 years ago [  1  ]. It is now well recognized that psoriasis can  be  triggered  by  streptococcal  infection,  particularly  guttate psoriasis but also plaque psoriasis [  2  ]. Oligoclonal expansion of T cells occurs in the tonsils in response to streptococcal colonization, and the same T-cell repertoire is found in the peripheral blood and skin of patients with guttate psoriasis [  3,4  ]. It has been proposed that psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that is fuelled by persistent intracellular streptococcal infection [  4  ]. Streptococci are facultative intracellular bacteria and are not eliminated by standard antibiotic therapy, which may explain the lack of effi  cacy of antibiotics in treating guttate psoriasis [  5  ].

Tonsillectomy  appears  to  be  effective  in  some  patients.  Of  29 patients with plaque psoriasis exacerbated by sore throats, 13/15 randomized to tonsillectomy showed signifi  cant improvement in psoriasis over 2 years compared to none in the control group. The tonsillectomy  group  was  also  found  to  have  reductions  in  skin homing T cells compared to controls [  6  ].

HIV infection can lead to exacerbation of psoriasis (see p. 35.18  ).

## Medications

Many drugs have been reported to be responsible for the onset and/or  exacerbation  of  psoriasis  [  1,2  ].  Their  risk,  however,  has rarely been assessed in controlled epidemiological studies. Conversely, rechallenge studies in individual patients has established causation for specifi  c agents. The most important medications that may exacerbate psoriasis  in  current  clinical  practice  are  lithium salts,  synthetic  antimalarials,  interferon α [ 3  ]  and  TNFα inhibitors  [  4  ]. Beta-blockers,  non-steroidal  anti-infl  ammatory  drugs (NSAIDs)  and  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitors have  been  implicated  in  small  case  series  and  a  case-crossover study  [  5  ]  but  not  supported  in  a  larger  population-based  casecontrolled analysis [  6  ]. Given the known co-morbidities of psoriasis, β -blockers, ACE inhibitors and NSAIDS are widely prescribed in patients with psoriasis and yet, in most, do not appear to have a major detrimental effect.

Although psoriasis may respond to oral corticosteroids, both tachyphylaxis  and  rebound  phenomena  occur.  Withdrawal  of corticosteroids may lead to rebound of the disease and the development of unstable psoriasis - withdrawal should be by steady dose reduction rather than abrupt termination [  7  ].

## Alcohol misuse

There is good evidence that excessive alcohol consumption is associated with moderate to severe psoriasis [  1-5  ]. One Finnish study of over 5000 patients reported an excess mortality from alcohol-related causes in patients with psoriasis who had been admitted  to  hospital  for  treatment  of  their  disease.  The  standard mortality ratio for alcohol-related deaths were 4.46 (95% CI, 3.60-5.45) for men and 5.60 (95% CI, 2.98-8.65) for women [  6  .  Psoriasis  appears  to  be  more  prevalent  (15%)  in  patients ] with alcoholic liver disease and patients undergoing outpatient treatment for alcohol dependence [  7  ]. Alcohol misuse as measured by anonymous questionnaires appears to occur in about 30% of patients with moderate to severe disease [  8,9  ] and one Irish  study  reported  that  7%  of  patients  have  alcohol  dependence [  9  ]. Alcohol misuse is associated with more severe skin disease,  increased  levels  of  anxiety  and  depression,  and  contributes  to  increased  cardiovascular  risk  [  10  ].  Screening  for alcohol misuse should be considered in those with more severe disease [  9  ]. There is a close relationship between alcohol misuse and cigarette smoking [  2-4  ,  6  ].

## Cigarette smoking

Cigarette smoking is increased amongst patients with plaque psoriasis compared to the normal population, particularly in women [  1-5  ]. Patients who smoke are at increased risk of developing psoriasis, of having more severe disease and of developing psoriatic arthritis [  6  ]. Smoking has multiple immunological effects that may contribute to the initiation and persistence of psoriasis [  7  ]. There is a particularly strong association between cigarette smoking and palmoplantar pustulosis [  7  ].

## sychological distress P

There  is  a  complex  relationship  between  psoriasis  and  psychological  distress.  Up  to  80%  of  psoriasis  patients  report  that

psychological distress results in fl  ares of their disease [  1  ].  Moderate  to  severe  psoriasis  is  associated  with  increased  levels  of depression,  anxiety  and  worry  compared  to  the  general  population [  2  ]. In a large epidemiological study using the UK General Practice  Research  Database,  patients  with  psoriasis  were  more likely to have a   diagnosis of depression (hazard ratio 1.39 (95% CI, 1.37-41)), anxiety (1.31 (95% CI, 1.29-1.34)) and suicidality (1.44 (95% CI, 1.32-1.57)). Approximately 20% of patients require treatment with   antidepressants [  3  ].

Patients  with  psoriasis  may  have  abnormal  cognition  [  4  ]. Functional  magnetic  resonance  brain  imaging  is  abnormal  in psoriasis  compared  to  controls  and  may  be  due  to  abnormal responses to infl  ammation [  5  ]. We can therefore envisage a situation whereby psychological distress results in abnormal skin infl  ammatory responses and the subsequent infl  ammation can result  in  abnormal  central  nervous  system  function  [  6  ].  The pathophysiological  mechanisms  underpinning  the  association between  psoriasis  and  psychological  distress  are  unclear  [  1  ]. There is evidence that neurogenic infl  ammation is important in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [  7  ]. There are numerous anatomical and physiological connections between the nervous system and the skin known as the 'neurocutaneous axis' or brain-skin axis  [  8,9  ].  These  include  substance  P,  calcitonin  gene  related peptide [  10  ], nerve growth factor [  11  ] and corticotrophin-releasing hormone [  12  ]. Combined with the increased numbers of sensory nerve fi  bres in psoriasis plaques, this suggests that these connections  may  be  important  in  psoriasis  pathogenesis  [  9  ]. In imiquimod-induced psoriasiform infl  ammation in a murine model, pharmacological ablation of a subset of cutaneous nociceptive  neurons  causes  a  reduction  in  IL-23  production  from dermal  dendritic  cells,  with  a  consequent  reduction  in  IL-23 dependent cytokines from Th17 cells and reduced infl  ammation [  13  ]. Neurotransmitters  have  immunomodulatory  properties and may play a role in the maintenance of plaques [  14  ].  This hypothesis is supported by the clinical observation that sensory nerve transection may result in clearance of psoriasis in the area of anaesthesia [  10  ,  15  ].

There appears to be a neuroimmunocutaneous axis that both triggers  and  maintains  cutaneous  infl  ammation  in  psoriasis. Acute experimental psychological stress can affect Langerhans cell function [  16  ] and skin barrier function [  17  ]. In similar studies,  acute  experimental  distress  results  in  hypocortisolaemic responses in patients with psoriasis compared to healthy controls [  18  ].

Psychological  co-morbidities  may  reduce  treatment  effi  cacy. Abnormal levels of anxiety and worry decrease the effi  cacy of psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) [  4  ]. Depression may be associated with increased alcohol intake and contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease associated with psoriasis [  19  ]. The question arises whether interventions that focus on psychological distress can improve the physical disease [  20  ]. A controlled study assessed  a  group  cognitive-behavioural  therapy  programme  on psychological variables and psoriasis area severity index (PASI) in patients with psoriasis. After 6 weeks, there was a signifi  cant improvement in psychological variables compared to controls and also a signifi  cant improvement in psoriasis as measured by PASI. This effect was still seen 6 months after the study [  4  ]. A controlled trial of an educational programme that encompassed mindfulness meditation,  weight  loss,  yoga  and  psoriasis  education  reported signifi  cant improvements in both dermatology life quality index (DLQI)  and  PASI  compared  with  a  non-intervention  control group. This effect was no longer evident 9 months after the study [  21  ]. A study assessing mindfulness-based meditation in patients undergoing PUVA demonstrated more rapid clearance of psoriasis in the intervention arm compared to controls [  22  ]. A trial assessing the effi  cacy of online cognitive-behavioural therapy was effective in improving anxiety and quality of life scores but not depression scores or PASI [  23  ]. A more recent randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy reported improved subjective psoriasis severity and quality of life in patients who underwent the intervention compared to a control group [  24  ].

A systematic review of psychological interventions for psoriasis concluded that there is still insuffi  cient  evidence  to  support  the view that these interventions are generally benefi  cial in psoriasis [  25  ]. Nonetheless these studies provide some evidence that there is a clinically important connection between psychological distress and physical disease in psoriasis.

## Sunshine

Although  sunlight  is  generally  benefi  cial,  in  5-20%  of  patients psoriasis  may  be  provoked  by  sunlight  (Figure    35.1  )  and  cause summer  exacerbations  in  exposed  skin.  Some  of  these  patients gave a history of polymorphic light eruption (PLE) with psoriasis appearing as a Koebner phenomenon within PLE lesions [  1  ]. In a study of 20 British patients, severely photosensitive psoriasis was found in younger patients, affecting  women almost exclusively. Although monochromator testing is generally  normal,  psoriasis may be induced by low-dose broadband UVA directly,  without koebnerization [  2  ]. Photochemotherapy (PUVA) can be helpful in these patients [  3  ].

## Physical trauma

Psoriasis  can  occur  in  sites  of  cutaneous  trauma  and  old  scars, the  so-called  Koebner  phenomenon  fi  rst  described  by  Heinrich

Koebner in 1877. The pathogenic mechanisms seen in psoriasis are analogous to accelerated wound healing and it is proposed that trauma  can  initiate  innate  immune  activation  with  subsequent specifi  c  immune  activation  and  keratinocyte  hyperproliferation and angiogenesis. Up to 25% of patients report the development of  psoriasis  in  sites  of  skin  trauma  [  1  ]  and  this  is  commoner  in patients who are HLA-C:06:02 positive [  2  ].

## Pathogenic mechanisms

The pathological abnormalities in psoriasis include hyperproliferation  of  the  epidermis,  a  marked  dermal  and  epidermal infl  ammatory infi  ltrate, increased angiogenesis within the dermis  and  abnormal  cutaneous  neuronal/neurotransmitter organization.  There  are  a  multitude  of  interacting  molecular processes  that  result  in  these  abnormalities  and  the  clinical cutaneous phenotype.

Normal basal keratinocytes proliferate, differentiate and ascend through the layers of the epidermis before undergoing senescence  and  entering  the  keratin  layer.  This  process  takes approximately  30  days  in  healthy  individuals.  In  plaques  of psoriasis, there is hyperproliferation of the basal layer with subsequent  rapid  progression  through  the  epidermal  layers  and decreased differentiation. The rete ridges are elongated, there is acanthosis and an absence of the granular layer [  1  ]. The progression of the basal cell keratinocytes through the epidermis takes only  4-5  days  in  active  plaques.  It  is  worth  noting  that  clinically normal skin in psoriasis patients has abnormal epidermal dynamics [  2,3  ].

The knowledge that epidermal keratinocytes in psoriasis proliferated abnormally suggested that this was the primary abnormality in psoriasis. While the presence of a mixed dermal and epidermal infl  ammatory infi  ltrate was recognized, the primacy of the keratinocytes in psoriasis pathogenesis was accepted until the early 1980s. The recognition that ciclosporin was effective in psoriasis suggested that activated T cells were crucial to psoriasis pathogenesis [  4  ]. (It is, however, now known that keratinocytes express  cyclophilins  (which  bind  ciclosporin)  and  calcineurin and that ciclosporin may have direct effects on cytokine production by keratinocytes [  5  ].)  The  demonstration that IL-2 DAB, a fusion protein that delivers diphtheria toxin selectively to activated T cells, was effective in psoriasis added evidence to this concept [  6  ].

Numerous  immunohistochemical  studies  have  reported  on immunocytes in affected  psoriasis  plaques.  Cells  of  the  innate immune system including macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells and natural killer cells are present in  signifi  cantly  larger  numbers  compared  to  uninvolved  skin and healthy control skin [  7  ]. Langerhans cell numbers in the epidermis  of  uninvolved  psoriasis  skin  appear  normal  compared to control skin but their migration from the skin in response to TNFα is impaired [  8  ].

The mechanism of immune activation in psoriasis is not understood although several mechanisms have been suggested. The classic immunological response to viral infections and intracellular bacteria include Th1 and Th17 cytokines and the presence of  CD8+  T  cells.  Psoriasis  may  result  from  the  inappropriate persistent activation of infl  ammation in response to   commensal viruses or bacteria. Various models have been proposed linking  innate  immune  activation  and  the  initiation  of  psoriasis plaque formation. Injury to or infection of the skin results  in antimicrobial peptide production and increased Toll-like receptor  activation.  The  antimicrobial  peptide  LL-37  (cathelicidin) binds  to  self-DNA  [  9  ]  enabling  binding  to  and  activation  of Toll-like  receptor  9  and  induction  of  interferonα production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. LL-37 also binds to self-RNA inducing myeloid dendritic cells  to  produce  TNFα ,  IL-6  and IL-23 [ 10 ].  This  results  in  activation  of  T  cells  of  the  adaptive immune system, specifi  cally Th17 cells, which in turn activate keratinocytes to proliferate and produce multiple chemokines and antimicrobial peptides [ 10 . Activated T cells are of the Th1, ] Th17 and Th22 phenotype, with a dearth of Th2 cells. In psoriasis plaques there are increased levels of IL-2, IL-8, interferon- , γ TNFα , IL-15, IL-17, IL-22 and IL-23 [ 10 11 , ]. There is a distinct absence of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10. The activation of T cells is oligoclonal suggesting antigen-specifi  c activation, but the nature of the antigen(s) in psoriasis remains unknown [  12  ].

T-cell  cytokines  such  as  interferonγ , TNFα , IL-6  and  IL-22 cause keratinocyte proliferation, and chemokines (such as CCL20 and CCR6) and antimicrobial peptide production [ 10 11 , ,13  ].  The IL-20  family  of  cytokines  including  IL-19,  IL-20  and  IL-24  also cause keratinocyte proliferation. These cytokines cause activation of innate immune cells including IL-17 activation of neutrophils, antigen-processing  dendritic  cells  which  in  turn  activate  T  cells and  the  infl  ammatory  loop  self-perpetuates  [ 10 11 , . ] Regulatory T cells, which should inhibit the formation of such infl  ammatory loops, appear functionally defi  cient in psoriasis [  14  ]. Psoriasis is therefore  often  described  as  a  complex  interaction  between  the innate immune system, T cells and the skin with a similar but distinct  immune  profi  le  to  rheumatoid  arthritis,  multiple  sclerosis and type 1 diabetes.

There are interesting differences between psoriasis and other immunological diseases. There are no autoantibodies recognized in this disease. This is similar to Crohn disease but differs from rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and autoimmune conditions such as Graves disease, and perhaps refl  ects the lack of Bcell activation seen in psoriasis. Tissue destruction and scarring do not occur in psoriasis [  15  ]. This may be a function of epidermal regeneration.

## Histopathology

## arly changes E

Vasodilatation, papillary oedema and leukocyte infi  ltration appear to  precede  epidermal  changes  in  early  developing  lesions  [  1  ]. Compact hyperkeratosis, disappearance of the granular layer and slight  epidermal  hyperplasia  follow.  Mitotic  fi  gures  in  keratinocytes, and leukocytic infi  ltration in spongiotic foci, are seen in the lower half of the epidermis. Scattered mounds of parakeratosis set in a still predominantly orthokeratotic stratum corneum appear, with or without neutrophils. In the Malpighian layer, neutrophils may accumulate to form the characteristic spongiform pustules of Kogoj [  2  ] (Figure   35.2  ). Epidermal hyperplasia with rete ridges of even length and prominently dilated, tortuous papillary   capillaries

(Figure   35.4  ). The rete ridges are often clubbed, branched or fused at their bases, with mononuclear leukocyte infi  ltrates in the lower half  of  the  epidermis.  Dilated,  tortuous  papillary  blood  vessels almost touch the undersurface of the thinning suprapapillary epidermis and are surrounded by a mixed mononuclear and neutrophil infi  ltrate, as well as extravasated erythrocytes. Invasion of the epidermis with leukocytes takes place particularly in the suprapapillary region [  3,4  ].

## Clinical features

## History

Pruritus  is  often  the  dominant  symptom  and,  although  not  as severe  as  in  atopic  eczema  [  1  ],  is  experienced  by  the  majority of patients and contributes to the impairment in quality of life, partly through disturbed sleep [  2,3  ]. Skin tightness and burning are frequent in unstable, erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis and pain may be experienced in areas of fi  ssure formation, particularly in palmoplantar or fl  exural disease [  4  ]. Shedding of scale can  be  a  signifi  cant  symptom,  for  instance  in  scalp  psoriasis, and contributes to feelings of embarrassment. The impact of the disease  and  its  symptoms  on  patients'  relationships,  activities and occupation can be severe and its assessment may be assisted by patient completed questionnaires.

The  fi  rst  manifestation  of  psoriasis  may  develop  at  any  age and in general those with earlier onset disease are more likely to have a family history of psoriasis. The course of the disease including the frequency of relapses and remissions varies greatly between  individuals.  Exacerbating  factors  should  be  enquired after, and responses to previous treatments noted. It is   important to ask concerning the involvement by psoriasis of specifi  c sites that  may  not  be  volunteered  by  the  patient,  for  instance  the ano-  genital  region  [  5  ].  A  detailed  medical  history  should  be taken  which  includes  an  enquiry  after  symptoms  of  common co-  morbidities, particularly of articular symptoms.

## resentation P

Plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis, accounting for about 80-90% of all cases [  1  ]. It presents as a papulosquamous rash, and the diagnosis is based on the typical appearance of individual lesions and their characteristic distribution on the skin. Typical lesions are red scaly plaques, which are remarkably well demarcated from unaffected skin, with sharply delineated edges (Figure   35.5  a,b). Plaques may be encircled by a clear peripheral zone, the halo or ring of Woronoff (Figure   35.6  a,b)

![Image](35-with-image-refs_artifacts\image_000006_a9995afc10ecdb3a38f51084286eb1a78a9e79ec258ab79a53e6898c15d99cdf.png)

[  2  .  There may be any number of lesions or only a single one. ] When multiple, lesions are usually monomorphic and distributed relatively symmetric  ally over the scalp, trunk and extensor  surfaces  of  the  limbs.  They  vary  in  diameter  from  one  to several  centimetres  and  are  oval  or  irregular  in  shape.  Large plaques may form by coalescence of smaller plaques and are commonly seen on the legs and sacral region. Involuting lesions often clear from the centre initially, producing annular or arcuate  shapes.  Linear  and  geometric  confi  gurations  may  arise  at the  sites  of  trauma  as  an  isomorphic  (Koebner)  phenomenon (Figure   35.7  a,b).

The colour of the plaques, a full rich red (sometimes referred to as 'salmon pink') (Figure   35.8  ), has a particular depth of hue not  normally  seen  in  eczema  or  lichen  simplex.  This  quality  of colour is  of  particular  diagnostic  value  in  lesions  on  the  palms, soles and scalp. In fair-skinned individuals, the colour is less rich and almost magenta pink. In dark-skinned races, the quality of the colour is lost [  3  ] (Figure   35.9  ). Erythema may persist at the site of a previously treated plaque for many months. Postinfl  ammatory

hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation are also both frequent and occasionally lentigines may persist following clearance of a plaque (Figure   35.10  ) [  4  ].

Most psoriasis lesions are surmounted by silvery white scales, which vary considerably in thickness (Figure   35.11  a,b). The amount of scaling may be minimal in partially treated disease, and in the flexures. When scaling is not evident it can often be induced by light scratching, a useful sign in diagnostically uncertain lesions. The  successive  removal  of  scales  usually  reveals  an  underlying smooth, glossy red membrane with small bleeding points where the  thin  suprapapillary  epidermis  has  been  torn  off  (Auspitz's

sign) (Figure   35.12  ). The epidermal thickening characteristic of the psoriatic process causes the lesions to be raised from the adjoining skin, and easily palpable. There is evidence that the thickness of untreated plaques varies between patients but is relatively constant in an individual and may predict response to treatment [5  ].

These diagnostic features may not all be present at the same time or in every case, and are sometimes obscured or evanescent. The variety of morphologies of plaque psoriasis has led some authors

to attempt a reclassifi  cation according to phenotype and to speculate that it may in fact be several distinct disease entities [  5  , 6 , 7  ].

## soriasis affecting specifi  c sites P

## calp psoriasis S

The scalp is one of the commonest areas to be affected by plaque psoriasis and often the site fi  rst affected. The whole scalp may be diffusely  involved,  or  multiple  discrete  plaques  of  varying  size may be seen [  1  ]. Very thick plaques can develop, especially at the occiput. Plaques tend to be restricted to hair-bearing areas, extending a short distance beyond the hairline and around the ears.

The rate of hair growth is normal [  2  ] and common scalp psoriasis is not a frequent cause of alopecia, although it may occur [  3  . Psoriatic erythroderma is associated with severe hair loss, as ] is vigorous local treatment. A morphological entity consisting of plaques of asbestos-like scaling, fi  rmly adherent to the scalp and associated  hair,  has  been  termed  pityriasis  (tinea)  amiantacea [  4    (Figure   35.13  a,b).  It  is  most common in children and young ]

![Image](35-with-image-refs_artifacts\image_000015_bd540b07d351c9b416f30716c7e4a611adec916a3662e94b558ae578e6d50c1c.png)

adults,  and  is  best  regarded  as  a  non-specifi  c  reaction  pattern, which may be seen in other scaling scalp conditions. It may be an early manifestation occurring before the other stigmata of psoriasis. Hair loss, sometimes cicatricial, may be seen in pityriasis amiantacea.

## ollicular psoriasis F

Psoriasis  affecting  the  hair  follicles  on  the  trunk  and  limbs  follicular psoriasis (Figure   35.14  ) - may occur as an isolated phenomenon, or in association with plaque psoriasis. The lesions are smaller than the typical lesions of guttate psoriasis and may be either  grouped,  or  diffuse  [  1,2  ].  In  children  it  may  be  confused with pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP).

## Seborrhoeic psoriasis (sebopsoriasis)

Plaques  of  thin  sharply  demarcated  erythema  with  variable scale may occur in the typical distribution of seborrhoeic dermatitis,  involving  paranasal  areas,  external  ears,  medial  eyebrows,  hairline,  presternal  and  interscapular  chest  wall  [  1  ]. This may occur in individuals with plaque psoriasis. When it arises as an isolated phenomenon, it is diffi  cult to distinguish from seborrhoeic dermatitis, and may represent a koebnerization of psoriasis within this entity. Involvement of the face other than in a seborrhoeic distribution is uncommon in adults, and when it occurs is often an indication of widespread psoriasis elsewhere on the skin [  2  ].

## lexural psoriasis (inverse psoriasis) F

Psoriasis involving the inguinal creases, axillae, submammary folds (Figure   35.15  ), gluteal cleft, umbilicus (Figure   35.16  ) and other body folds is more common in older adults and is associated  with  obesity  [  1  ].  Flexural  involvement  is  often  seen  in individuals with plaque psoriasis elsewhere on the skin. Less frequently, lesions are confi  ned to fl  exural sites, and sometimes referred to as inverse psoriasis [  2  ]. Inverse psoriasis may occur as a primary disorder or as a Koebner phenomenon on top of infective or seborrhoeic intertriginous dermatoses.  Failure to  respond  to  antibacterial  or  antifungal  preparations  should arouse suspicion.

Flexural plaques are thin, scaling is greatly reduced or absent, and  a  confi  dent  diagnosis  may  therefore  be  diffi  cult.  In  common with lesions at other sites, the plaques are anhidrotic [  3  ], but  hyperhidrosis  of  the  surrounding  skin  may  cause  maceration and friction that alter the appearance of the psoriasis, which nevertheless  retains  its  characteristic  colour.  The  surface  has  a glazed hue and fi  ssuring at the depth of the skin fold is common, especially in the gluteal cleft. The edges of the lesions are usually well defi  ned, unless secondary infection or medicament dermatitis, both quite common events, have occurred. Involvement of the napkin area (psoriatic napkin eruption) may be the fi  rst presentation of psoriasis in infancy [  4  ].

## Genital psoriasis

Genital skin can be considered a type of fl  exural skin, and there are similarities between psoriasis as it affects fl  exural and genital sites. The genital skin is often involved in individuals with inverse psoriasis, less frequently in those with plaque psoriasis and may

be the only manifestation of psoriasis. It has been shown to cause particular problems with sexual function [  1,2  ].

Skin  of  the  scrotum  and  penile  shaft  may  be  affected  by  psoriasis  but  the  glans  penis  is  the  most  frequently  affected  part.  In circumcised men, lesions on the glans are similar in appearance to plaques at other sites. In the uncircumcised, the plaques lack scale but the colour and well-defi  ned edge are usually distinctive (Figure    35.17  a,b).  Where  confi  rmatory  signs  elsewhere  are  absent,  a diagnostic biopsy may be necessary as it may resemble erythroplasia or plasma cell balanitis.

Patients  with  vulval  involvement  often  complain  of  marked pruritus. The most common vulval presentation is a symmetrical, erythematous,  non-scaly,  well-demarcated  thin  plaque  affecting the labia majora (Figure   35.18  ). Psoriasis is amongst the commoner causes of chronic vulvitis in children, and amongst adults should be  considered in the differential  diagnosis  of  chronic  erythematous vulvitis without vaginitis [  3  ].

## Non-pustular palmoplantar psoriasis

On the palms and soles (Figure   35.19  a,b), psoriasis may present as typical scaly patches on which a fi  ne silvery scale can be evoked by scratching; as less well-defi  ned plaques resembling lichen simplex  or  hyperkeratotic  eczema;  or  as  a  pustulosis.  Mixed  forms occasionally occur [  1  ]. It is often diffi  cult to distinguish between psoriasis  and  eczema,  with  which  it  may  sometimes  appear  to alternate. A  sharply  defi  ned  edge  at  the  wrist,  forearm  or  palm (Figure   35.20  a,b) and absence of vesiculation are helpful.

typical character. There may be a relationship to trauma or occupational irritants [  2  ].

## Nail psoriasis

The nails grow more quickly in patients with psoriasis [  1  ]. Nail dystrophy may be seen in association with all types of psoriasis or occasionally as an isolated feature. Estimates of its incidence vary considerably. Minor degrees of involvement (e.g. pitting) are difficult to define clinically but abnormalities of the nail unit have been detected by ultrasonography in up to 73%

of patients with plaque psoriasis [  2  ]. On clinical examination, nail changes are present in about 40% of cases at any point in time [  3  ] and the lifetime prevalence is significantly higher. Nail psoriasis  is  associated  with  more  extensive  psoriasis,  longer disease duration, family history of psoriasis and the presence of  psoriatic  arthritis.  In  one  German study, psoriatic arthritis was present in more than twice as many psoriasis patients with nail disease [  3  ].

Psoriasis may affect any part of the nail unit, including the nail  matrix,  nail  bed  and  hyponychium.  Nail  matrix  disease presents with pits, ridges and grooves of the nail plate. Pitting (Figure   35.21  a,b) is the most frequent change seen in fi  ngernails, individual pits being uniform in size at about 1 mm diameter and sometimes arranged longitudinally. Nail bed disease can be seen as subungual 'oil drops' which are highly specifi  c for psoriasis (Figure   35.22  ) [  4  ]. Nail bed disease also causes subungual

hyperkeratosis,  splinter  haemorrhages  and  distal  onycholysis (Figure    35.23  a,b).  It  can  be  diffi  cult  to  distinguish  clinically between toenail bed psoriasis and onychomycosis, which quite often coexists [  5,6  ].

## Mucosal lesions

Whether psoriasis affects the oral mucosa is a matter of controversy  [  1  ].  True  mucosal  involvement  appears  to  be  rare.  Geographic  tongue  (benign  migratory  glossitis)  (Figure    35.24  )  and fi   ssured  tongue  are  both  more  frequent  among  patients  with psoriasis  than  healthy  controls  [  2,3  ].  The  association  of  both psoriasis and geographic tongue with HLA-C:06:02 provides further evidence that the two disorders are related [  4  ], but whether geographic  tongue  is  an  oral  manifestation  of  psoriasis  per  se remains to be established.

## Ocular lesions

Psoriasis may affect ocular structures directly, or by associated immunological  phenomena.  Direct  involvement  of  the  eyelids or  eyelid  margins  may cause blepharitis and its consequences, which are the most frequent ocular complications of psoriasis. A chronic non-specifi  c conjunctivitis has also been reported to be common in psoriasis, and xerosis may also be seen [  1  ]. Keratitis is rare. Uveitis is an important immunologically mediated complication and has been found to be associated with more extensive  psoriasis  [  2  ].  It  is  more  strongly  associated  with  psoriatic arthritis [  3  ].

## Clinical variants (based on morphology or natural history)

## Acute guttate psoriasis

This describes the sudden onset of a shower of small lesions, appearing diffusely over the body (Figure   35.25  ). It should be distinguished from small plaque psoriasis and follicular  psoriasis,  which  follow a  more  chronic  course.  In  one  series,  12%  of  all  affected  psoriasis patients had experienced acute guttate disease [  1  ]. It is more common in children and young adults in whom it may be the fi  rst presentation of psoriasis. It frequently follows several weeks after phanyngitis caused by group A streptococci, serological evidence for which can be found in about 60% of individuals [  2  ]. A guttate fl  are may also

occur in adults with plaque psoriasis and in this context is more common in patients whose psoriasis had its onset in childhood [  3  ].

n  the  early  stages  of  acute  guttate  psoriasis  there  may be litI tle scaling. The lesions are from 2 or 3 mm to 1 cm in diameter, round or slightly oval. They are scattered more or less evenly over the body, particularly on the trunk and proximal part of the limbs, rarely on the soles but not infrequently on the face, ears and scalp. Lesions on the face are often sparse, diffi  cult to see and disappear quickly. Although guttate lesions are normally profuse, there are occasionally no more than half a dozen present on the body, and in the early stages the colour is not specifi  c. The diagnosis is made chiefl  y from the nature of the scaling, the general distribution and

evidence  for  preceding  infection.  Lesions  usually  resolve  over about 3 months. A signifi  cant minority of patients with acute guttate psoriasis subsequently develops plaque psoriasis [  4  ].

## Unstable' psoriasis (syn. active psoriasis, eruptive ' infl  ammatory psoriasis)

In contrast to the lesions in plaque psoriasis which are static for prolonged periods, in some individuals and in some phases of the disease there is more marked activity in the form of enlargement of plaques that can become more intensely erythematous (Figure   35.26  a,b), and the development of many new smaller plaques. Patients may complain of more pain or pruritus within the plaques. The Koebner phenomenon is thought to be more frequent in this phase of the disease [  1 . The immediate outcome is unpredictable; the lesions may return ] to the inactive state, or progress to localized pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis. Patients may develop such unstable phases repeatedly, settling back again into the stable forms of the disease. Recognized precipitants  include  withdrawal  of  systemic  or  potent  topical  corticosteroids, treatment with irritants such as tar or dithranol, acute infection, hypocalcaemia and perhaps severe emotional upset. Serum levels of IL-17 and the IL-1 receptor antagonist are higher in patients during the unstable phase of the disease [  2  ].

## Erythrodermic psoriasis

Erythrodermic psoriasis, in which most or all of the body surface is affected by psoriasis, is uncommon, occurring in 1-2% of patients [  1,2  ]. Psoriasis has been found to be the underlying cause in about 25% of cases of erythroderma [  3  ]. Erythroderma in psoriasis may be chronic, due to the gradual extension of plaque psoriasis (Figure   35.27  ), or acute as part of the spectrum of '  unstable' psoriasis

(Figure    35.28  ).  In  the  chronic  form,  the  individual  may  be  systemically well, the clinical characteristics of psoriasis are retained and there are usually some areas of uninvolved skin. Mild topical treatments are well tolerated and the overall prognosis is good.

The acute form is often precipitated by environmental or therapeutic  triggers  including  systemic  illness,  alcoholism,  antimalarials,  irritating  topical  treatments,  ultraviolet  radiation  or  by withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids, ciclosporin or methotrexate.  The  patient  may  be  febrile  and  systemically  ill.  Dependent oedema is common. Itching is often severe. The entire skin may be affected and the clinical characteristics of psoriasis are often lost. There may be clinical overlap with generalized pustular psoriasis.  Untreated,  the  course  is  prolonged,  relapses  are  frequent and  there  is  an  appreciable  mortality.  Complications  are  those of  skin  failure,  including  sepsis  [  4  ],  hypothermia  or  hyperthermia, hypoalbuminaemia, anaemia, dehydration and high output ardiac failure. c

## Pustular psoriasis

See p. 35.32.

## Atypical forms of psoriasis

In a disease as common and variable as psoriasis, atypical forms are  frequent.  Many  unusual  localizations  have  been  recorded, including  digital  and  interdigital  forms.  Verrucous  lesions  particularly affect the legs. Rupioid, elephantine and ostraceous psoriasis  are  terms  sometimes  used  to  describe  plaques  associated with gross hyperkeratosis. Rupioid psoriasis refers to limpet-like cone-shaped  lesions.  The  term  elephantine  psoriasis  might  be used to describe unusual but very persistent, thickly scaling, large plaques  that  sometimes  occur  on  the  back,  limbs,  hips  or  elsewhere (Figure   35.29  ). Ostraceous psoriasis, an infrequently used term,  refers  to  a  ring-like  hyperkeratotic  lesion  with  a  concave surface, resembling an oyster shell.

## Other specifi  ed forms of psoriasis (based on age, precipitants)

## inear and segmental psoriasis L

True linear or segmental psoriasis, in which lesions are unilateral or Blaschko linear, is extremely unusual (Figure   35.30  ). It has been called  isolated  linear  psoriasis  when  it  occurs  alone,  or  superimposed linear psoriasis when, as occurs more frequently, it arises in association with non-segmental plaque psoriasis (Figure   35.31  ) [  1  ]. The segmental lesions tend to arise at a young age, and are often more severe and treatment refractory than the associated non-segmental disease [  2,3  ]. Segmental manifestations are thought to represent genetic mosaicism arising by postzygotic loss of heterozygosity or a postzygotic new mutation at a psoriasis susceptibility locus [  1  ].

This  phenomenon should not be confused with infl  ammatory linear verrucous epidermal naevus or a Koebner response of psoriasis on verrucous epidermal naevus of the non-infl  ammatory type or at the site of prior herpes zoster.

## Psoriasis in childhood and old age

Psoriasis  is  common  in  children  with  a  cumulative  prevalence up to 18 years of 0.71% [  1  ]. Congenital psoriasis is very rare. In some  series  girls  outnumber  boys  [  1,2  ].  Psoriasis  in  children  is

signifi  cantly associated with several co-morbidities including obesity and diabetes [  1  ,  3  ]. There is no evidence that onset of psoriasis in childhood predicts severe disease in adult life [  4  ].

All  of  the  clinical  variants  of  psoriasis  described  in  adults  are recognized in childhood but with a different frequency according to the age group. Establishing the diagnosis in infancy can be challenging because of limited involvement or an atypical appearance. The napkin area is frequently the fi  rst site affected; under the age of 2 years, napkin psoriasis with or without disseminated lesions is the most frequent form, presenting with well-defi  ned erythema devoid of scale [  5  ]. At this site, psoriasis must be differentiated from irritant contact dermatitis and seborrhoeic dermatitis. Napkin seborrhoeic dermatitis is a particular diagnostic problem as a signifi  cant proportion of affected children develop plaque psoriasis in adulthood [  6  ].

Guttate psoriasis is more frequent in children than adults, particularly under the age of 12 years [  7  ]. In older children, plaque psoriasis is the most frequent presentation, and the face and anogenital sites appear to be affected more frequently than in adults [  5 ,7  ]. The disease often fi  rst appears in the scalp, where it may present as pityriasis amiantacea (see Figure   35.13  a,b). Apart from the common forms, several other patterns of psoriasis occur in childhood. Interdigital tinea is uncommon in children and a toe cleft intertrigo may be psoriatic. Other fl  exural forms also occur (see Figure   35.18  ). The disease may mimic chronic blepharitis, usually unilaterally, with a small plaque of psoriasis on one eyelid extending to the lid margin, or on the cheek at the angle of the mouth. Erythrodermic and pustular variants of psoriasis are rare in childhood. Pustular psoriasis may be the fi  rst presentation of psoriasis, and tends to follow a benign course. Although localized pustular psoriasis is extremely rare in children, parakeratosis pustulosa (an indolent and recurrent scaling pustular acrodermatitis, sometimes around the nail of only one digit) usually proves to be psoriatic [  8  ]. Psoriatic arthritis is relatively uncommon in childhood.

n older age groups, psoriasis that starts for the fi  rst time after I the age of 65 years tends to be less extensive than early-onset disease [  9  ].  There  is  less  often  a  family  history  of  psoriasis.  Plaque psoriasis  with  prominent  scalp  involvement  is  the  commonest phenotype. Inverse psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis may be more common than in early-onset disease [  10,11  ] whereas guttate and generalized pustular psoriasis are rare [  9  ].

## Drug-induced or exacerbated psoriasis

See p. 35.4  .

## hotoaggravated psoriasis P

See p. 35.5  .

## HIV-induced or exacerbated psoriasis

The  association  between  severe  psoriasis,  psoriatic  arthropathy and HIV infection is well recognized. Psoriasis may be the fi  rst presentation of HIV infection, as may the deterioration in previously stable disease. Plaque psoriasis is the most frequent phenotype, with a predilection for the scalp and palmoplantar skin [  1  ]. Sebopsoriasis,  rupioid  psoriasis  and  psoriatic  erythroderma  are also common, as are mixed patterns [  2  ]. Psoriasis tends to be more prevalent in the later stages of HIV-related immunodysfunction, but may occur earlier. The mechanism of worsening of psoriasis in HIV infection is unclear and represents a paradox, given that helper T cells are the major target of HIV. Suggested explanations include HIV-induced reduction in regulatory T cells, an increased number of memory CD8+ T cells, effects of HIV on dendritic cell populations,  HIV  proteins  acting  as  superantigens,  or  shared genetic variants between psoriasis and HIV responder status [  3  ]. One suggestion is that HIV affects peripheral blood helper T cells and affects to a lesser degree cutaneous resident memory T cells which are pathogenic in psoriasis [  4  ]. Psoriasis tends to improve with  a  reduced  viral  load,  especially  on  treatment  with  highly active antiretroviral therapy [  5  ].

## Differential diagnosis

The clinical characteristics already described are usually suffi  cient to enable the diagnosis to be made, but doubt may arise in atypical cases, in particular sites, and when psoriasis is complicated by or alternates with other diseases. The diseases that need to be distinguished from psoriasis vary depending on the clinical variant of psoriasis and the site affected (Table   35.2  ).

n seborrhoeic dermatitis, the lesions are lighter in colour, less I well defi  ned and covered with a dull or branny scale. Eczema at times develops a psoriasiform appearance, especially on the legs. Hyperkeratotic eczema of the palms is a common cause of misdiagnosis. Colour, scratch-evoked scaling and well-defi  ned margins are suggestive of psoriasis, and nail changes may be diagnostic. Lichen planus could give rise to diffi  culty when the two diseases alternate  or  coexist,  especially  when  present  as  hypertrophic lesions on the legs, as penile lesions and on the palms. The violaceous colour, Wickham's striae and the presence of oral changes are usually decisive. Lichen simplex can resemble psoriasis closely, particularly on the scalp and near the elbow. The intensifi  ed skin markings, rather ill-defi  ned edge and the marked itching are characteristic, and the point of the elbow tends to be avoided. Pityriasis lichenoides chronica can closely resemble guttate psoriasis, but the lesions are usually less evenly scattered, have a brownish red or orange-brown colour and are capped by a 'mica-like' scale. Candidiasis shows a glistening deep red colour suggestive of psoriasis, particularly in the fl  exures, but scaling tends to be confi  ned to the edge, and small satellite pustules and papules are usually evident outside the main area. Tinea cruris has a well-defi  ned, often polycyclic  edge,  but Trichophyton rubrum infections,  especially  of  the palm, may cause diffi  culty. If corticosteroids have been applied, scaling may be absent and the diagnosis must be made by microscopy and culture of skin scrapings.

Less common causes of confusion are PRP and secondary syphilis. The resemblance to PRP may be close, especially in the erythrodermic phase. The colour of PRP is generally less distinct, and dark red follicular lesions are apparent, and the acquired palmar and plantar keratoderma has a yellow-orange tinge. The psoriasiform lesions of syphilis may cause diffi  culty to the inexperienced; condylomas, mucosal lesions and other signs of the disease are usually found, if sought. Porokeratosis of Mibelli on the palms and soles, patches of Bowen and Paget disease and penile erythroplasia may resemble psoriasis, but the lesions are often solitary. Mycosis fungoides can clinically also appear similar to psoriasis. In atypical psoriasis that does not respond to conventional therapy, this diagnosis  should  be  considered  and  appropriate  investigations should be performed such as a skin biopsy. The coexistence of two infl  ammatory diseases should also be considered - for example, allergic contact dermatitis (and koebnerization) in the context of psoriasis.

## Classifi  cation of severity

The biological severity of psoriasis varies greatly between patients, and in some patients over time. There are neither validated nor clinically  useful  laboratory  markers  of  the  activity  of  psoriasis,  which  is  currently  assessed  clinically.  In  a  recent  review,  53 clinical  instruments  for  assessing  psoriasis  severity  were  identified [  1  ],  none  of  which is ideal for all purposes. The PASI is the most widely used in clinical trials and in clinical practice, and its use in a specialist setting as both a severity score and an outcome measure has been endorsed in several European clinical practice guidelines and systematic literature reviews [  1-3  ,    ]. The PASI was 4 initially developed in 1978 as an outcome measure in a clinical trial of etretinate in psoriasis and has since been partially validated [  5  ]. Affected body surface area (BSA) is estimated for the head and

able   35.3 T Erythema, scaling and induration are graded in each region and a combined score ranging from 0 to 72 calculated as Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI).

neck, trunk, upper limbs and buttocks separately with a correction factor to allow for the differing surface areas of these four regions. Erythema, scaling and induration are graded in each region and a combined score ranging from 0 to 72 calculated as in Table   35.3  . PASI is not appropriate in forms of psoriasis other than plaque disease, e.g. guttate or pustular psoriasis, when a record of percentage BSA affected may be preferred. The PASI has been criticized as non-linear with a low response distribution, resulting in a lack of sensitivity to change in mild psoriasis [  6,7  ], and because it is also complicated to calculate, the static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) may be more appropriate in a non-specialist environment [  8  .  This  is  an  assessment  of  the  average  erythema,  scaling  and ] induration of all psoriasis lesions on a 5-, 6- or 7-point rating ranging from 'clear' to 'very severe', without assessment of affected BSA. Although not well standardized, it is straightforward to use and easy to understand. There remains a need for further assessment tools for use in site-specifi  c psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, psoriasis in children and in pigmented skin types.

There are several aspects of psoriasis severity other than its clinical activity at one point in time, as assessed by the PASI or PGA. These include the cumulative activity of psoriasis over time, the presence of co-morbidities (particularly psoriatic arthritis), treatment responsiveness and, importantly, the impact on the patient as recorded in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores. The most frequently used measure of HRQoL has been the skin-specifi  c tool the DLQI, which is simple to administer, validated and useful in clinical  trials  and  in  clinical  practice  [  9  ].  This  10-point questionnaire generates a score from 0 to 30, and scores of greater than 10 have been shown to refl  ect a very large effect on a patient's life [  10  ]. The DLQI has been criticized for being infl  uenced by the patient's  age  and  gender,  and  as  being  relatively  insensitive  to the effects of psoriasis on mood, stress, sleep, fatigue and addictive  behaviours  [  11,12  ].  More  recently  developed  scores  include Skindex-17, and in clinical trials, generic quality of life instruments such as the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and EQ-5D are also often used [  13  ]. Quality of life scores (e.g. DLQI) correlate only moderately with psoriasis severity scores (e.g. PASI), because they measure different aspects of the disease [  1  ]. Psoriasis on the

face, hands or genitals may have a disproportionate effect on quality of life resulting in a high HRQoL score with a relatively low PASI. Alternatively, a mismatch between a low PASI and signifi  cantly impaired HRQoL score can suggest comorbid depression, and  psychological  support  should  be  considered  under  these circumstances [  14  ].

The severity of psoriasis is continuously  distributed  and, although  attempts  have  been  made  to  categorize  psoriasis,  the thresholds  are  arbitrary  and  not  standardized.  Severe  psoriasis has been variously defi  ned as a PASI &gt;12 [  15  ], as a PASI ≥10 with a DLQI ≥10 [  3  ,  16  ] or a score of 10 or more in either the PASI or DLQI or BSA &gt;10% [  17  ].

## Complications and co-morbidities

Although  historically  considered  to  be  a  disease  primarily  of the  skin  which  is  not  otherwise  hazardous  [  1  ],  there  has  been an  increasing  awareness  that  patients  with  psoriasis  experience increased morbidity and mortality from a range of systemic diseases,  affecting  most  major  organ  systems  [  2  ].  Patterns  of  disease association are recognized, but the precise aetiology of this 'multimorbidity'  is  uncertain,  and  may  include  shared  genetic susceptibility, direct effects of psoriasis per se, effects of psoriasis treatments and the consequences of behavioural responses to living with chronic disease. There is also some evidence of underrepresentation of several diseases in the psoriasis population, for instance cutaneous infections in early-onset psoriasis [  3  ].

## mmune-mediated infl  ammatory diseases I

Psoriatic arthritis is the most frequent infl  ammatory disease associated with psoriasis (see p. 35.42  ). Infl  ammatory bowel disease (IBD) is also more frequently observed, an observation that has led to considerable  advances  in  our  understanding  of  genetic  mechanisms particularly with respect to innate immunity and key T-cell differentiation pathways. In a Canadian population-based study, psoriasis was found in about 6% of patients with IBD, with a similar prevalence in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis [  1  ]. In a study of 33 981 patients with psoriasis in Germany, the prevalence of Crohn disease (0.92%) or ulcerative colitis (1.09%) was signifi  cantly greater than in  the  non-psoriasis  control  population  [  2  ].  In  another  study,  the risk of incident cases of Crohn disease but not of ulcerative colitis was elevated in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [  3  ]. The risk of other immune-mediated diseases including autoimmune thyroid disease and type 1 diabetes may be increased in patients with both psoriasis and IBD compared with those who have psoriasis alone [  4  ].

There are reports of an association between psoriasis and CD, or CD-associated antibodies. A recent Swedish population-based study of 28 958 individuals with biopsy-verifi  ed  CD  revealed  a twofold increased risk of psoriasis [  5  ], and this is supported by an Israeli case-control study of 12 502 patients with psoriasis, in which an increased prevalence of CD was identifi  ed in the psoriasis group [  6  ]. There may be an increased risk of several end-organ specifi  c  autoimmune  diseases  including  alopecia  areata,  vitiligo and urticaria, particularly in psoriatic arthritis [  7  ].

## nfection I

It has  long  been  known  that  patients  with  psoriasis  may carry  staphylococci  on  their  plaques  [  1  ]  and  using  modern ulture-independent molecular techniques the microbiota of psoc riasis plaques has been shown to differ from uninvolved skin and from the skin of unaffected individuals [  2  ]. Despite this, clinical infection of psoriasis lesions is rarely a problem. Occasionally, fl  exural  psoriasis  becomes  clinically  infected,  especially  if  fi  ssuring occurs (e.g. in the natal cleft). The relative resistance of psoriasis skin  to  infection  is  probably  in  part  caused  by  the  overexpression  of  endogenous  antimicrobial  peptides  (cathelicidins  and β -defensins) [  3  ]. Retrospective reports suggest that psoriasis may be a risk factor for infection in joint replacement surgery [  4  ] leading orthopaedic surgeons to defer elective surgery in those with psoriasis plaques until these have been adequately treated.

n addition to the known effect of streptococcal infection in trigI gering disease, patients with psoriasis have been shown in a prospective study to be 10 times more likely to develop pharyngitis than household controls, and streptococci are more likely to be isolated in association with a sore throat than controls [    ]. 5

## sychological distress P

Psoriasis  is  associated  with  signifi  cant  psychological  distress, including  dysfunctional  thought,  pathological  worrying,  fear  of stigmatization, effects on self-image, personality and temperament [  1-4  ]. Excessive alcohol consumption has been found signifi  cantly more commonly in men with severe psoriasis than in other groups with the disease, and could be a consequence of stress caused by severe skin disease [  5  ].

Psoriasis is also associated with a signifi  cant psychiatric morbidity. In a study utilizing the UK General Practice Research Database, the  hazard  ratios  for  a  diagnosis  of  anxiety,  depression  or  'suicidality' (suicidal ideation, suicide attempt or suicide) corrected for age and gender were 1.39, 1.31 and 1.44, respectively. The risk of depression  in  those  with  severe  psoriasis  (defi  ned  as  prescribed phototherapy or systemic treatment) was higher still, affecting 32% of patients, and was more frequent in younger people [  6  ]. This has been confi  rmed in a recent meta-analysis of the published literature, which revealed that 28% of patients in tertiary care had depressive symptoms and up to 19% a diagnosis of clinical depression [  7  ].

## Cancer

There are reports of an association between various cancers and psoriasis, although some of the studies are of low methodological quality with insuffi  cient accounting for potential confounding variables. The extent to which these effects may relate to psoriasis  per  se,  treatment  or  disease  severity is not apparent [  1  ].  The strongest association is with non-melanoma skin cancer, the incidence of which is raised in patients with psoriasis compared with the general population [  2  ]. High-dose PUVA is known to increase the risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell  carcinoma  [  3  ],  and  this  may  be  compounded  by  immunosuppressive  treatments,  including  ciclosporin,  methotrexate  [  4  ], TNFα inhibitors [  5  ] and possibly high-dose UVB [  6  ].

There is some evidence for a modestly increased risk in psoriasis  of  systemic  lymphoma, particularly Hodgkin lymphoma [  7  ]. Although rare, this association creates signifi  cant  challenges  for further  treatment. A  possible  association  between  psoriasis  and cancer  in  other  organs  including  the  renal  tract,  pancreas  and colon, remains uncertain [  8-11  ].

## Metabolic syndrome and its components (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obesity, diabetes)

The metabolic syndrome (truncal obesity, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and insulin resistance) is increasing in prevalence in the general population. There are complex interrelationships between the  metabolic  syndrome  and  chronic  infl  ammation.  In  a  representative sample of the UK population in 2012, the prevalence of the  metabolic  syndrome  was  found  to  be  signifi  cantly  elevated in patients with psoriasis at 34% compared with 26% of the unaffected population (odds ratio 1.50, 95% CI 1.40-1.61) [    ]. Similar 1 results have recently been published in a meta-analysis of observational studies [  2  ]. The risk is highest in those with more extensive disease. Psoriasis has been shown in many population-based epidemiological studies to be statistically associated with arterial hypertension [  3-5  ], hyperlipidaemia [  6  ], type 2 diabetes [  7-9  ] and obesity [  10,11  ].

The strongest of these associations is with obesity [ 1 ,  which ] can  be  seen  in  childhood  psoriasis,  and  tends  to  predate  the onset of psoriasis [  12  ]. Obesity in adults appears to be a risk factor for the development of psoriasis [  11  ]. Patients who are obese (BMI  &gt;30)  have  more  severe  psoriasis  than  lean  patients  [  13  ]. Obesity may decrease treatment responsiveness and appears to be  one  of  the  main  reasons  for  the  development  of  premature cardiovascular  disease  [  10  ,  13  ,  14  ].  Psoriasis  severity  is  associated with insulin resistance and medications that target insulin resistance  may  be  effective  in  psoriasis  [  13  ].  Preliminary  data suggest that weight loss in obese patients with psoriasis, either by low-energy diet or bariatric surgery, improves quality of life and may improve psoriasis severity [  15  ]. In a randomized trial in overweight or obese patients receiving systemic treatment, an intervention group who received a supervised calorie restricted diet with a programme of aerobic exercise for 20 weeks had a signifi  cantly greater improvement in PASI compared with a group randomized to non-  intervention [ 16 . ]

In relation to the components of the metabolic syndrome, there is evidence of undertreatment, and lack of physician awareness, in comparison to other chronic infl  ammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis [  17  ].  In  a  Danish  nationwide  registry  of  psoriasis patients, 28% of those with hypertension were not prescribed treatment [  18  ].

## Cardiovascular disease

Patients with severe psoriasis die at a younger age than unaffected people  and  cardiovascular  disease  accounts  for  the  majority  of this excess mortality [  1  ]. Psoriasis signifi  cantly increases the risk of stroke (RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.04-1.4) and myocardial infarction (RR 1.22; 95% CI 1.05-1.42) separately [  2  ]. The risk appears to be greatest in younger patients with more severe disease or with psoriatic arthritis [  3  ]. There is also an increased risk of peripheral vascular disease, atrial fi  brillation and of venous thromboembolism [  4-6  ].

Much of the increased vascular risk probably relates to behaviours (such as cigarette smoking, which is more frequent amongst those  with  psoriasis)  and  traditional  cardiovascular  risk  factors such as  the  components  of  the  metabolic  syndrome.  The  extent to which psoriasis contributes independently and in addition to these conventional risk factors is controversial, but some epidemiological studies have demonstrated an increased vascular risk after correcting for many known risk factors [    ,  8  ]. In addition, sys7 temic treatment of psoriasis with methotrexate or TNFα inhibitors may be associated with reduced frequency of cardiovascular events [  9,10  ],  although this needs further evaluation in prospective studies.

## Hepatobiliary disease

Death rates due to liver disease have been reported to be signifi  cantly elevated in patients with severe psoriasis [  1  ]. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most frequently identifi  ed liver pathology, present in up to 50% of patients with psoriasis [  2-4  ]. It is associated with obesity, the metabolic syndrome and more severe psoriasis.  Alcoholic  liver  disease  is  also  common  [  5  ].  Neutrophilic cholangitis is a recognized cause of liver dysfunction in patients with  generalized  pustular  psoriasis  and  occasionally  in  plaque psoriasis [  6  ].

## Others

In  several  epidemiological  studies,  an  increased  risk  in  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been reported, independently of  confounding  variables  such  as  smoking  [  1,2  ].  There  are  rare reports of acute respiratory distress syndrome complicating erythrodermic or generalized pustular psoriasis [  3  ]. Renal involvement due to psoriasis is rare: secondary amyloidosis has occasionally been  reported,  as  have  instances  of  immunoglobulin  A  (IgA) nephropathy [  4  ]. Psoriasis is also associated with an increased risk of hyperuricaemia and gout [  5  ]. Pregnancy outcomes in patients with mild psoriasis appear to be unaffected, but in severe disease a higher prevalence of adverse outcomes including spontaneous abortion, pre-eclampsia and low birth weight have been suggested although these fi  ndings are not consistent between studies in different populations [  6-9  ].

## Disease course and prognosis

n many instances, plaque psoriasis is chronic and persistent, changI ing little over years. In other individuals, the disease is less stable with  considerable  variation  in  the  extent  and  degree  of  infl  ammation,  sometimes  in  relation  to  environmental  triggers  such  as infections, alcohol consumption, emotional stress or climate. This remains as unpredictable as it was 150 years ago. 'It is impossible to say, in any particular case, how long the disease will last, whether a relapse will occur, or for what period of time the patient will remain free  from psoriasis' [  1  ].  In  the  few  longitudinal  studies  that  have been done, spontaneous remission occurs in between a third and a half of patients, and has been reported for as long as 54 years [  2,3  ]. The cause of these spontaneous remissions is unknown. There is little doubt that even severe cases can be maintained in prolonged remission by the use of systemic or biological treatment. Untreated, relapse is the rule, however completely the lesions have been treated and by whatever method. The time to relapse varies enormously between  individuals  and  between  therapeutic  modalities.  Only three of 260 patients in one series were clear for 5 years or more and most of the rest for only 6 months [  4  ]. In another series, only three out of 95 were clear for 5 years or more and 11% relapsed rapidly [  5  . Guttate attacks carry a better prognosis than those of a slower ] and more diffuse onset, and have longer remissions after treatment [  6  .  Few  studies  have  assessed  the  long-term  prognosis  for  fi  rst ]

episodes of guttate psoriasis. In one study, only fi  ve of 15 patients followed up 10 years after an initial episode of guttate psoriasis had developed plaque disease [  7  ]. At the other extreme, erythrodermic and pustular forms carry an appreciable mortality and arthropathic forms a considerable morbidity. It is now known that severe plaque psoriasis will also appreciably shorten life expectancy by an average of 4-6 years [  8,9  ].

## nvestigations I

The diagnosis of psoriasis is usually clinical and there is no reliable diagnostic test. A skin biopsy of lesional skin may occasionally be helpful in atypical cases. There is no constantly present laboratory abnormality in uncomplicated psoriasis. High sensitivity C-reactive  protein  may  be  mildly  elevated,  with  higher  levels  seen  in psoriatic arthritis and generalized pustular psoriasis [  1,2  ]. Identification of valid biomarkers in the skin or peripheral blood of disease severity, natural history and response to therapy is a focus of global research in stratifi  ed medicine. Investigations appropriate for initiating or monitoring of systemic and biological treatments may be required. Screening for known co-morbidities should also be undertaken which will include assessments for psoriatic arthritis, metabolic syndrome and depression.

## Management

## General

Every  patient  with  psoriasis  presents  an  individual  problem. Treatment depends upon many variables including age, gender, occupation, personality, general health, intelligence and resources, as well as the type, extent, site, duration and natural history of the disease. Extensive psoriasis may be ignored by the phlegmatic, yet minor lesions on exposed areas can be ruinous for others. Treatment should be appropriate to disease severity and importance in that individual. It should not be more unpleasant, intolerable or dangerous than the disease itself. Reassurance and emotional support are invaluable, stressing the non-contagious and benign nature of psoriasis, and the availability of a wide range of effective treatments. The importance of talking to patients, trying to allay their  concerns,  coupled  with  advice  on  how  to  handle  negative beliefs about their disease cannot be overestimated. As stated earlier, cognitive-behavioural therapy as an adjunct to pharmaceutical therapies in patients with psoriasis has shown a signifi  cantly greater reduction in psoriasis severity compared to pharmaceutical therapy alone [  1  ]. Indeed, high worry appears to have a signifi  cant detrimental effect on response to PUVA therapy and is the best predictor of outcome [  2  ]. Spa treatment, involving rest and relaxation  in  an  area  where  high  sunlight  exposure  is  possible, such as the Israeli Dead Sea coast, may induce remissions [  3  ].

Attention to the patient's  general,  physical  and  psychological health is always worthwhile. Known co-morbidities, for instance psoriatic arthritis and cardiovascular disease, should be actively looked for and treated. Lifestyle and behaviours that contribute to general health and treatment responsiveness such as weight management and smoking cessation should be addressed.

The  disease  remains  incurable  and  there  is  no  current  evidence that treatment alters its natural history. The patient should be  encouraged  to  consider  realistic  targets  for  treatment,  which may be subjective, or utilize a numerical scoring system such as DLQI. For physicians, response to treatment should be recorded objectively  using  appropriate  severity  scores  such  as  PASI  and PGA. It is useful to consider treatment in two phases: induction of remission, and subsequent maintenance of remission. In inducing remission, 75% reduction in PASI from baseline (PASI 75) has been widely adopted as a minimum response criterion for severe plaque psoriasis in clinical trials. With the availability of higher effi  cacy  treatments,  this  standard is rising to PASI 90, or preferably a low absolute PASI (e.g. PASI &lt;3). However, the physician must take a long-term view, and long-term safe control of psoriasis  is  equally  important.  Increasingly,  the  cost  of  treatment  is a signifi  cant consideration in planning a treatment strategy. The management of psoriasis is a rapidly developing and increasingly specialized  therapeutic  area  and  up-to-date  local  and  national guidelines should be consulted.

## opical treatment T

Topical  therapies  are  the  mainstay  of  treatment  for  psoriasis  of limited extent. Patients with more extensive psoriasis also often use topical therapies, at least for selected body areas. The main groups of topical therapies are emollients, corticosteroids, vitamin D and its analogues, coal tar, dithranol and retinoids (Table   35.4  ). As well as differences in effi  cacy and side effects, some of these preparations  are  easier  to  use  than  others  for  different  patterns of  psoriasis.  There  is  a  need  for  more  effective  and  better  tolerated treatments for patients who fail to respond to fi  rst line topical treatment. New developments in this fi  eld include the topical Janus kinase inhibitors although not yet licensed [  1  ].

## opical corticosteroids T

Topically applied corticosteroids are of established value in psoriasis [    ,  2  ]. Potent and very potent topical corticosteroids are the 1 most  effective  topical  monotherapies  for  outpatient  use  [ 3 and ] are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as fi  rst line topical treatment on cost-effectiveness grounds [  4  ]. Mild to moderate potency corticosteroids are the treatment of choice on the face and neck, fl  exures and genitalia, and are also used in unstable, erythrodermic and generalized pustular

psoriasis. Potent and very potent corticosteroids are suitable for scalp psoriasis [  2  ] and plaque psoriasis at sites of thick skin such as  the  palms  and  soles.  Newer  formulations  of  corticosteroids, particularly foams, are easier to apply than traditional creams or ointments and can be used for scalp, truncal or limb psoriasis [  5  ]. Intralesional corticosteroid infi  ltrated intradermally into localized lesions of psoriasis by needle injection is a valuable technique in small resistant plaques, for instance on the backs of the hands and knuckles. The effect may be long lasting and repetition of the injection unnecessary for several months. In the treatment of psoriasis of the fi  ngernails, the nail fold can be injected, but results are often disappointing and the procedure may be painful [  6  ].

Topical  corticosteroids  are  associated  with  a  lower  incidence  of short-term  local  adverse  events  than  other  topical  treatments  [ 1 . ] They generally lack irritancy, do not stain skin or clothing and have the merits of ease of application. They are frequently combined with other  topical  agents  to  counteract  irritancy .  The  combination  of  a potent topical corticosteroid with calcipotriol provides the most effective strategy for topical treatment of limited plaque psoriasis over a short period of time [ 3 . The potential side effects of topical corticos-] teroids are well known and include cutaneous atrophy (Figure   35.32  ), tachyphylaxis, rebound fl  are and systemic absorption, although there is a lack of data about the magnitude of these risks [ 1 . It is prudent to ] limit the use of potent topical corticosteroids to stable plaque psoriasis affecting limited areas, as long-term use may exacerbate the disease. Potent topical corticosteroids tend not to induce a lasting remission, unlike tar or dithranol which have the potential to do so.

## Vitamin D analogues

calcipotriol  [  2-4  ]  and  1,24-dihydroxyvitamin  D   (tacalcitol)  [  5,6  ] 3 have all been shown to be effective when applied topically in psoriasis. The mechanism of action of these agents is via vitamin D receptor-mediated effects on the proliferation and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes [  1  ,  7  ] and on immunocytes, including shifting the Th1 cytokine profi  le of plaques towards Th2 [  8  ]. Topical formulations of calcipotriol and other vitamin D analogues are widely prescribed topical therapies for plaque psoriasis. Systematic  reviews  of  calcipotriol  attest  to  its  equivalence  or  superiority  to  other  available topical therapies apart from potent topical corticosteroids  [  9,10  ].  The  most  widely  prescribed  analogue  in current use, calcipotriol (50 μg/g) ointment, has been reported to be at least as effective as 0.1% betamethasone valerate ointment [  11,12  ]  and  more  effective  than  short-contact  dithranol  therapy [  13  ] in plaque psoriasis. Calcipotriol (50 μg/g) ointment has also been shown to be effective and safe in children when administered in amounts up to 45 g/week/m 2  [  14  ]. Side effects of calcipotriol include local irritation, which may affect up to 20% of patients, and can be particularly troublesome on the face. Vitamin D and its analogues all have the potential to affect systemic calcium homeostasis with hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia [  15  ]. It is prudent to restrict the amount of calcipotriol (50 μg/g) ointment to less than 100 g or 50 g/m  per week, and to monitor serum and urinary 2 calcium levels should these doses be exceeded.

Calcipotriol cream appears to be less effective than the ointment formulation  [  16  ]  but  cosmetically  more  appealing.  Combining calcipotriol  monotherapy  applied  in  the  morning  with  a  potent topical corticosteroid such as halobetasol ointment applied in the evening for 2 weeks was superior to either drug used twice daily [  17  ].  Based on this observation, a stable ointment formulation of calcipotriol  50  μg/g  and  betamethasone  dipropionate  0.5  mg/g has been licensed for therapy. This combination shows superior effi  cacy to either calcipotriol or betamethasone alone with better clearance and faster onset of action [  18,19  ]. The introduction of a gel formulation of the combination product has improved tolerability in managing scalp psoriasis and is also useful for plaque psoriasis at other sites [  20  ].

Long-term treatment of plaque psoriasis with calcitriol (3 μg/g) ointment confi  rmed shorter term effi  cacy studies [  1  ]. No statistically signifi  cant changes in serum or urinary calcium levels have been found, even in patients using large quantities to treat up to 35% of the BSA for 3 months [  21  ]. Transient local skin irritation may occur, but calcitriol 3 μg/g ointment is better tolerated than calcipotriol ointment for treatment of the face and fl  exures [  22  ].

T acalcitol 4 μg/g ointment applied once daily is effective for the treatment of plaque psoriasis but is probably less effective than calcipotriol 50 μg/g ointment [  10  ].

Calcipotriol  and  tacalcitol  have  been  combined  with  other therapies. Calcipotriol ointment enhances the effi  cacy of PUVA and UVB phototherapy [  23,24  ]. As  UVA  partly  inactivates  calcipotriol [  25  ] and UVB is absorbed by calcipotriol [  26  ], it is recommended that calcipotriol is not applied immediately prior to phototherapy  exposures.  Tacalcitol  ointment  when  combined with PUVA is UVA sparing [  27  ] and calcitriol is UVB sparing in combination  [  28  ].  Calcipotriol  50  μg/g  ointment  used  in  combination  with  methotrexate  enables  lower  cumulative  doses  of methotrexate to be used [  29  ].

## Dithranol

Dithranol  is  a  synthetic  derivative  of  chrysarobin,  which  was originally  extracted  from  the  bark  of  the  araroba  tree.  The  use of dithranol for the treatment of psoriasis was fi  rst described by Unna in 1916 [  1  ] and its use became widespread following the discovery that its stability can be increased by combination with salicylic acid. The mechanism of action of dithranol may relate to its antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on keratinocytes [  2-4  ] and it also reduces neutrophil and lymphocyte migration [  5,6  ].

Dithranol  therapy  for  psoriasis  was  formalized in the Ingram regimen; in-patients were treated with a tar bath, suberythemogenic UVB and then dithranol in Lassar's paste applied to plaques, starting at a concentration of 0.05-0.1% and increased cautiously to reduce irritation up to a maximum concentration of 4% [  7,8  ]. The stiff paste prevented spread onto perilesional skin, which can become irritated by dithranol. Clearance rates with the Ingram regimen were reported at over 95% with remission times of 6 months or longer [  7  ,  9  ]. Clearance rates and remission times were similar to PUVA in a randomized controlled trial of 224 patients [  10  ]. In the 1980s, the recognition that dithranol could penetrate the epidermis in 100 min led to the concept of short-contact dithranol. This, in conjunction with increased fi  nancial pressure on in-patient dermatology beds, led to the development of day care centres for psoriasis therapy. Out-patient short-contact dithranol is less effective [  11  ] but more cost-effective than in-patient therapy [  12  ]. It has a similar effi  cacy to topical vitamin D analogues in head to head trials [  13  ]. Three times weekly short-contact dithranol may be as effective as fi  ve times weekly [  14  ].

Dithranol  produces  brown staining of the skin (Figure   35.33  ), which  resolves  about  2  weeks  after  therapy  is  completed.  It  is not generally useful for facial or fl  exural psoriasis due to signifi  cant irritation (Figure   35.34  ). Several attempts have been made to make dithranol more acceptable for patient self-administration at home. These have included cream and other newer formulations designed to minimize irritation and staining [  15,16  ]. Despite these modifi  cations, the use of dithranol as an out-patient therapy for psoriasis has declined [  17  ]. Its high effi  cacy and excellent safety record suggest that it should still be promoted as a treatment for plaque psoriasis.

## Coal tar

Coal  tar  is  the  byproduct  of  coal  distillation  and  contains  over 100 000 individual compounds,  predominantly  hydrocarbons. Coal tar was pioneered for the treatment of psoriasis by Goeckerman in the 1920s, applied on an in-patient basis for 24 h in combination with suberythemogenic doses of UVB. In a day care setting, modifi  ed Goeckerman regimens cleared over 90% of patients with an average duration of remission of 8 months [  1  ]. The mode of action of topical tar therapy is incompletely understood but clearance of psoriasis with the Goeckerman regimen is associated with decreased serum levels of infl  ammatory cytokines [  2  ].

The  effi  cacy  of  modifi  ed  Goeckerman  regimen  using  coal  tar applied for 5 h/day in combination with narrow-band UVB (NBUVB) in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis has been confirmed in a recent Taiwanese study. After 4-6 weeks of therapy, the  mean PASI reduced from 27.1 to 6.9. There were signifi  cant improvements  in  anxiety,  depression  and  quality  of  life  scores

and the mean remission time (i.e. maintenance of PASI-75) was 22 months [  3  ]. There are a number of reports of the success of modified Goeckerman regimens in patients whose psoriasis is refractory to biological therapy [  4,5  ]. The use of topical tar therapies in an in-patient setting and day care setting has reduced considerably in recent years, due to a reduction in dermatology in-patient beds and the inconvenience for patients of attending day care centres. Nonetheless, despite the advances in psoriasis therapies, the effi  cacy and safety of the Goeckerman regimen remains impressive.

The  use  of  coal  tar  outside  of  the  setting  of  day  care  and  inpatient treatment has had less impressive results. There are a small number of randomized controlled trials assessing the effi  cacy of new formulations of coal tar. In mild to moderate disease, a 1% coal tar solution, is similar in effi  cacy to calcipotriol cream and 5% coal tar cream [  6,7  ]. Topical coal tar has a remarkable safety record with no serious adverse effects reported even after decades of use [  8  .  In  the  short  term,  coal  tar  may  cause  folliculitis  and  contact ] allergy has been reported occasionally [  9  ].

## opical retinoids T

Retinoids,  with  their  pleiotropic  effects  on  cellular  proliferation and  differentiation,  would  appear  to  be  an  ideal  topical  preparation  for  psoriasis.  Early  studies  were  performed  with  topical alltrans retinoic  acid  (tretinoin).  Effi  cacy  was  reported  but  local -irritation was a major problem [  1,2  ]. The development of retinoic acid  receptor  (RAR)  selective  retinoids  facilitated  a  revisitation of the role of topical retinoids. Tazarotene is a synthetic retinoid, whose main metabolite, tazarotenic acid, binds to RARs β and γ [  3  .  T azarotene  applied  daily  for  3  months  is  signifi  cantly  more ] effective  than  vehicle  in  the  treatment  of  plaque  psoriasis  [  4,5  ]. The main drawback of tazarotene is local irritation at the site of application, and so it is frequently alternated with a potent topical corticosteroid [  6,7  ]. Tazarotene is probably best reserved for thick recalcitrant plaques of psoriasis.

## opical calcineurin inhibitors T

The  topical  calcineurin  inhibitors  tacrolimus  and  pimecrolimus were  initially  developed  for  the  treatment  of  atopic  eczema  in childhood. Both preparations have been shown to be effective for psoriasis affecting the face, neck, fl  exures and genitalia [  1-3  ] and may be  effective  under  occlusion  for  psoriatic  plaques  at  other sites. Their advantage is that unlike topical corticosteroids they are selective, unlikely to be absorbed systemically and do not produce skin atrophy making them more suitable for long-term use.

## hototherapy P

## Narrow-band UVB

Phototherapy with narrow-band UVB is the recommended fi  rst line therapy for most patients with moderate to severe psoriasis [  1  .  Broadband  UVB sources (290-320 nm) were used for nearly ] 100 years as part of the Goeckerman and Ingram regimens. The recognition  that  the  optimal  wavelength  for  treating  psoriasis was approximately 312 nm [  2  ] led to the development of TL-01 bulbs  that  produced  wavelengths  311-313  nm:  NB-UVB.  NBUVB evolved rapidly in the mid-1990s replacing broadband UVB therapy, as it is more effective and better tolerated [  3,4  ]. The effi  cacy is  comparable to PUVA with clearance rates (&lt;1% BSA) of over 90%, and average remission time of 16 weeks [  5,6  ]. NB-UVB has been combined with numerous therapies with apparent success, including methotrexate, acitretin, fumaric acid esters (FAEs) and biological therapies. NB-UVB should be avoided in patients who are taking ciclosporin due to concerns regarding accelerated cutaneous carcinogenesis [  7  ]. Several factors determine treatment outcomes with NB-UVB. Psoriasis severity, impairment of quality of  life  and  polymorphisms  in  the  vitamin  D  receptor  appear  to predict outcomes and remission times in psoriasis patients treated with NB-UVB [  6  ].

Ultraviolet B erythema is maximal at 48-72 h and this fact coupled with the dose-response curve for NB-UVB suggests that treatment should be given three times weekly. Thrice-weekly NB-UVB has been shown to clear psoriasis more quickly than twice-weekly NB-UVB [  8  ]. The British Photodermatology Group has published guidelines on dosing regimens for NB-UVB [  9  ]. The initial dose is based on skin phototesting and the determination of the minimal erythemal dose (MED) or on skin phototype. Patients' estimation of their skin phototype may be inaccurate so MED phototesting is preferred.

NB-UVB can cause erythema and pruritus in the acute setting and rarely blisters can develop in the resolving plaques [  10  ]. The cutaneous carcinogenic potential is unknown but animal studies suggest that NB-UVB may be less carcinogenic than PUVA, leading some authors to suggest that it can be used in patients who have reached the maximum number of lifetime PUVA treatments [  9  . Due to concerns regarding increased risk of SCC, the scrotum ] and genital skin should be protected from irradiation. Longitudinal prospective studies are needed to establish the long-term side effects of NB-UVB.

Ultraviolet  B  exerts  pleiotropic  effects  on  the  skin  and  the mechansism of  action  of  NB-UVB  remains  incompletely  understood.  NB-UVB causes cutaneous immunomodulation partly by increasing vitamin D [  6  ] and similar to PUVA induces apoptosis of T cells [  11-13  ] and reduces epidermal hyperproliferation [  14  ]. Recent studies also indicate that induction of keratinocyte apoptosis is involved in remodelling and resolution of hyperplastic psoriatic epidermis in response to NB-UVB [  15  ].

Narrow-band  UVB  is  a  highly  effective,  remission-inducing therapy in psoriasis with a long safety record. It continues to play a signifi  cant role in psoriasis management. Regular attendance at hospital phototherapy departments is required and limits the utility of phototherapy for some patients.

## PUVA photochemotherapy

PUVA is the acronym used for the combination of psoralens and long-wave ultraviolet radiation (UVA 320-400 nm). Psoralens bind to DNA and when activated by UVA cause permanent DNA damage with resulting cell death [  1  ]. This reduces keratinocyte hyperproliferation,  decreases  antigen-presenting  cells  in  the  dermis, reduces angiogenesis, causes T-cell apoptosis with associated clearance and remission of psoriasis [  2-4  ]. The psoralens that are commonly  used  are  8-methoxypsoralen  (8-MOP),  5-methoxypsoralen (5-MOP) and trioxypsoralen (T-MOP). Psoralens are used either topically or orally in combination with UVA. Small studies comparing topical bath PUVA to oral systemic PUVA have reported similar effi  cacy rates although bath PUVA is more time-consuming and resource intensive. Bath PUVA is not associated with nausea and obviates the need to wear UVA protectant spectacles on treatment days.

Oral PUVA therapy is given in dermatology centres according to dosing protocols. 8-MOP is usually given at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg 2 h before UVA therapy although it may be dosed according to the BSA. As the skin reacts to PUVA by developing pigmentation and epidermal hyperplasia, increasing doses are required as courses

progress. PUVA is usually given as a twice-weekly treatment and the average number of treatments to clearance is 18. Twice-weekly PUVA is as effective as three times weekly PUVA. The initial dose of UVA is calculated as 70% of the minimal phototoxic dose and 20%  increments  are  given  until  erythema  occurs.  The  scrotum and genital skin are more sensitive to the development of PUVAinduced skin cancers and should be protected from irradiation.

This  modality  is  highly  effi  cacious  in  treating  psoriasis  with reported clearance rates of over 90% [  5-8  ]. When PASI-75 results are reported using conservative analyses such as intention-to-treat, PUVA still compares favourably to systemic and biological agents [  9  . The average duration of remission (the time taken for 50% of ] a patient's psoriasis to return) is approximately 6 months. Guidelines on the use of PUVA for psoriasis have been published [  10  ].

PUVA can cause both acute and chronic side effects; these include erythema, maximal at 72-96 h, and blistering that is usually dose and skin phototype dependent. PUVA may also cause neurogenic pruritus (PUVA itch), commoner in fairer skin types and usually dose related [  11  ]. Patients describe a crawling under the skin that affects both psoriasis and normal looking skin. If treatment continues  PUVA  itch  usually  persists.  PUVA  is  associated  with  an increased incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer [  12-14  ]. This is true for both basal cell carcinoma and SCC although the incidence of SCC is increased more dramatically. The risk of SCC increases with the cumulative number of treatments, the total dose of UVA and in fairer skin types. Immunosuppression with ciclosporin also appears to increase this risk. The relative risk of cutaneous SCC starts to increase after 250 treatments in a lifetime. The British Photodermatology Group therefore recommends that a patient does not  receive  more  than  200  treatments  of  PUVA.  One  study  has reported an increased risk of malignant melanoma associated with high-dose PUVA (&gt;400 treatments) but this fi  nding has not been replicated [  15  ]. Due to the observed increased incidence in SCC, several  studies  have  attempted  to  make  PUVA  regimens  more effi  cient. PUVA may be combined effectively with oral retinoids, so-called re-PUVA. This allows an overall dose reduction in UVA dose but remission times are typically shorter [  16  ].

PUVA has been associated with cataract formation in mice but to date the relative risk of cataracts is the same in patients who have received PUVA compared to the background population. Nonetheless, it is still recommended that patients wear UVA protecting plastic-lensed glasses on treatment days. Psoralens are teratogenic and patients should be advised about this risk even in patients undergoing topical or bath PUVA.

PUVA remains one of the mainstays of treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis but its use is declining, and in the UK has been largely replaced with NB-UVB. It offers superb effi  cacy combined with a known toxicity profi  le. It is also a cost-effective therapy for severe disease.

## ystemic therapy S

The  initiation  of  systemic  therapy  is  a  shared  decision  between the patient and the clinician, after consideration of the risk-benefi  t profi  les of the available treatments. In general, systemic treatment is used for more extensive disease that is not responsive to topical therapy or phototherapy. However, the impact of disease may be suffi  cient that a patient in conjunction with their dermatologist would opt for earlier systemic treatment. Logistical factors may also play a part (e.g. ability to attend for regular phototherapy). Despite a large number of randomized controlled trials of systemic therapies for psoriasis, most are of poor quality and short duration (up to 3 months). There are few studies comparing different interventions, of maintenance therapy, long-term safety, relative safety, or effi  cacy in types of psoriasis such as pustular or erythrodermic disease. The main systemic treatments in current clinical practice are methotrexate, ciclosporin, acitretin and FAEs (Table   35.5  ). The choice  of  the  most  suitable  agent  in  an  individual  depends  on many variables including the person's age and plans for conception, the presence of psoriatic arthritis or other co-morbidities and the pattern of activity and current severity of their psoriasis.

## Methotrexate

The successful use of aminopterin therapy for psoriasis was fi  rst described in 1951 [  1  ]. It was soon replaced by methotrexate, which is a more stable folate antagonist that inhibits DNA synthesis by dihydrofolate reductase inhibition [  2  ]. Although initially thought to  inhibit  keratinocyte  hyperproliferation,  it  appears  to  inhibit lymphocyte proliferation more profoundly and probably acts via this mechanism in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Methotrexate is given orally at doses rising to a maximum of 30 mg weekly, and also by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection [  3  ]. Subcutaneous weekly methotrexate is used widely in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  and psoriatic arthritis [  4  ].  It  has  not  been  assessed in  controlled  trials  for  psoriasis.  It  has  been  suggested  that  this method  increases  the  bioavailability  of  methotrexate  and  may reduce side effects [  4  ]. Lower doses of methotrexate may be effective, particularly in the elderly, which may relate to reduced renal excretion  in  this  age  group.  Methotrexate  is  metabolized  in  the

liver and signifi  cant enterohepatic circulation occurs. The modern use of methotrexate for psoriasis is supplemented by folic acid. There is a wide variety in the dosing regimens of folic acid used [  5  . ]

Methotrexate is often used as the fi  rst systemic agent in plaque psoriasis,  particularly  if  there  is  concomitant  psoriatic  arthritis. It is also used in localized severe psoriasis, generalized pustular psoriasis and erythroderma, although its relatively slow onset of action  makes it  less  suitable  for  rapid  control  of  severe  disease. Early uncontrolled series of the effi  cacy of methotrexate in psoriasis reported clearance rates of up to 80% of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis [  6  ]. More recent placebo-controlled and active comparator studies have revealed a lower effi  cacy. In small studies comparing methotrexate with ciclosporin, effi  cacy of methotrexate 15 mg/week was found to be similar to ciclosporin 3 mg/kg/day at 16 weeks [    ] whereas methotrexate 7.5 mg/week increasing to 7 15 mg/week if necessary was found to be inferior to ciclosporin 3 mg/kg/day increasing to 5 mg/kg/day at 12 weeks [  8  ]. Methotrexate has also been used as an active comparator in clinical trials for the development of the biological agents adalimumab and briakinumab [ 9 ,10  ]. PASI-75 was achieved at week 16 in 35.5% of patients receiving methotrexate 7.5 mg orally increasing as tolerated and needed up to 25 mg/week, as against a PASI-75 rate in the placebo arm of 18.9% [ 9 .  In  the  second  study  using  a  simi-] lar methotrexate dosing strategy, PASI-75 was seen at week 24 in 39.9% of the methotrexate arm (no placebo arm) [  10  ]. These studies can be criticized for assessing response to methotrexate too soon, or for suboptimal dosing regimens. Methotrexate can take up to 6 months to achieve maximum effi  cacy although improvement can be  see  from  about  2  months.  Some  of  the  variation  in  response to methotrexate may relate to genetic polymorphisms in proteins that are involved in methotrexate transport and cellular function [  3  . T o date, these pharmacogenetic data are not suffi  ciently robust ] for use in the clinical setting. In those patients in whom methotrexate  is  effective,  long-term  studies  have  reported  both  long-term safety  and  effi  cacy  with  some  studies  reporting  favourable  outcomes in patients treated for 20 years or more [  11  ].

Methotrexate  therapy  for  psoriasis  can  cause  a  myriad  of  side effects including nausea, bone marrow suppression, mucositis and hepatotoxicity.  The  modern  use  of  low-dose  once-weekly  methotrexate for psoriasis is associated with hepatic fi  brosis in a minority of patients [  12  ]. A systematic review assessing hepatotoxicity from methotrexate in psoriasis patients revealed that hepatic fi  brosis was increased with a risk difference compared to controls of 0.22 (95% CI 0.04-0.41). There was no association between the cumulative methotrexate dose and the development of liver fi  brosis. The review commented that the quality of the evidence on this topic was poor [  13  ]. Methotrexate hepatotoxicity nonetheless appears to be commoner in psoriasis patients than in those with rheumatoid arthritis [  14,15  ]. This may be due to increased risk factors for liver injury amongst psoriasis patients such as obesity, alcohol abuse and diabetes and the fact that higher therapeutic doses are generally used when treating psoriasis compared to rheumatoid arthritis [  14  ]. Standard liver function tests are insuffi  cient to monitor patients for the development of hepatic fi  brosis. In a signifi  cant minority of patients liver fi  brosis can occur with normal liver enzymes. In the past, liver biopsies have been recommended in order to detect occult fi  brosis but the use of the serum aminoterminal peptide of pro-collagen III (PIIINP) as a biomarker of fi  brosis has reduced the need for routine liver biopsies in these patients [  12  ]. Although, to date, the level of evidence in psoriasis patients is limited [  16  ], the use of PIIINP is recommended by guidelines [  17  ]. The detection and monitoring of hepatic fi  brosis is a rapidly changing area with the use of new non-invasive markers such as transient elastography being reported recently [  18  ]. Some studies in rheumatoid arthritis suggest that the use of concomitant folic  acid  may  reduce  abnormalities  in  liver  enzymes  [  19  ].  There are no long-term studies assessing the use of concomitant folic acid with methotrexate therapy in psoriasis patients in terms of reducing hepatic fi  brosis. Pulmonary fi  brosis has only been reported rarely in psoriasis patients treated with methotrexate [  20  ]. This contrasts with  rheumatoid  arthritis  where  pulmonary  fi  brosis  induced  by methotrexate is a signifi  cant concern. Guidelines do however recommend a chest X-ray prior to starting methotrexate therapy. This is in order to screen for pre-existent pulmonary pathology that may be exacerbated by methotrexate [  17  ].

## Ciclosporin

Ciclosporin was reported as being effective for psoriasis in 1979 following a serendipitous observation in patients with psoriatic arthritis  who  received  the  treatment  as  part  of  a  pilot  study  in infl  ammatory  arthritis  [  1  ].  Ciclosporin  works  by  inhibiting  IL-2 production by lymphocytes via calcineurin inhibition. This results in the reduction of NFκ B and multiple cytokines including IL-2, TNFα and IL-8. The observation that ciclosporin was effective in psoriasis reinforced a change in thinking about the pathogenesis paradigm [  2  ]. Prior to this, psoriasis was considered to be primarily  a  disease  of  keratinocyte  hyperproliferation  with  secondary infl  ammation. The effi  cacy of ciclosporin confi  rmed the primacy of immunological abnormalities and led to a large body of research suggesting  that  psoriasis  is  an  immune-mediated  disease.  Calcineurin  is  also  expressed  in  epidermal  keratinocytes  and  other cell types in skin so that inhibition of nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) signalling in both the acquired and innate immune system may be important to its therapeutic effi  cacy.

Double-blind  placebo-controlled  trials  have  confi  rmed  early observations of effi  cacy, and suggest a maximum dose of 5 mg/ kg/day  [  3,4  ].  Ciclosporin  5  mg/kg/day  is  more  effective  than 2.5  mg/kg/day  [  5  ].  The  formulation  of  ciclosporin  is  clinically important. In a study of 309 patients, there was a mean reduction in PASI of 79% at 24 weeks using the Neoral ® formulation and 72% using the Sandimmune ®  formulation of ciclosporin. Over 80% of patients achieved PASI-75 at week 16 [  6  ]. Ciclosporin 2.5-5 mg/ kg/day was more effective than etretinate in a randomized controlled trial of 210 patients [  7  ].

There are two randomized controlled trials of ciclosporin compared  to  methotrexate  therapy.  In  a  study  of  88  patients  randomized  to  either  ciclosporin  2.5-5  mg/kg/day  or  methotrexate 15-22.5 mg weekly, there were similar responses in both groups. Thirty-three per cent of patients in the ciclosporin group achieved complete remission and 71% partial remission. In the methotrexate  group,  40%  and  60%  achieved  complete  and  partial  remission,  respectively  [  8  ].  In  a  similar  comparative  study,  Flystrom ® reported greater effi  cacy of ciclosporin (PASI-75 achieved in 58%) compared to methotrexate in a study of 84 patients [  9  ].

The long-term use of ciclosporin is associated with signifi  cant side effects. The major issues relate to renal impairment, hypertension  and  possible  increased  risk  of  malignancies  [  10  ].  As  a consequence, ciclosporin is now uncommonly recommended for maintenance treatment of psoriasis. It is used predominantly for the induction of remission when a swift response is required. Transition to another therapy with a more favourable side-effect profi  le is then recommended for long-term disease control [  11  ].

## Acitretin

Acitretin is a metabolite of etretinate which was the fi  rst retinoid used in the treatment of psoriasis. Etretinate has a narrow therapeutic  window and a long half-life and its use has been superseded  by  acitretin.  Acitretin  binds  to  nuclear  receptors  of  the steroid  superfamily,  which  includes  the  vitamin  D  receptor.  It reduces keratinocyte proliferation [  1  ] and also reduces Th17 cells with a concomitant increase in regulatory T cells [  2  ]. Acitretin is not immunosuppressant and therefore can be considered in clinical  situations  where  other  systemic  medications  are  contraindicated, such as active malignancy.

The evidence base for the use of acitretin in psoriasis is small and of low quality although more extensive and robust studies had been performed for etretinate. The effi  cacy of acitretin in psoriasis is dose dependent and NICE guidelines suggest dose escalation with a target dose of 25-50 mg/day and assessing effi  cacy at 4 months [  3  ]. Low-dose acitretin as monotherapy (10-25 mg daily) is of low effi  cacy and in one study daily doses of 50 mg or higher were required for signifi  cant effi  cacy [  4  ]. A  comparative study between acitretin and etretinate reported a 76% improvement in PASI in 127 patients treated with acitretin 0.54 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks [  5  ]. In a small controlled study of 20 patients, Gisondi et al reported a PASI-75 of . 30% in patients treated with acitretin 0.4 mg/kg/day after 24 weeks of therapy [  6  ]. In a comparative study with etanercept, PASI-75 at 12 weeks was achieved in 27% with acitretin 0.4 mg/kg/day [  7  ].

Acitretin is associated with mucocutaneous side effects, which are  dose  dependent.  Retinoids  can  cause  hyperlipidaemia  and rarely hepatitis. Acitretin is teratogenic and is contraindicated in pregnancy and due to its lipophilic nature can persist in adipose tissue for up to 2 years [  1  ].  Current  guidelines recommend that women of childbearing age must not become pregnant for 3 years after  cessation  of  acitretin  [  8  ],  which  precludes  its  use  in  most women of childbearing age.

There  are  many  reports  of  acitretin  use  in  combination  with other modalities. Retinoids and PUVA appear to act synergistically. The combination reduces the dose of retinoid and the energy of UV radiation needed to achieve remission and is highly effective, with complete remission reported in 94% of patients [  9  ]. Acitretin 0.3-0.5 mg/kg combined with NB-UVB or oral 8-MOP PUVA in 60 patients produced PASI-90 at 8 weeks in 57% of patients receiving re-UVB compared to 63% in the re-PUVA group [  10  ]. Similar results have been reported with bath PUVA and acitretin [  11  ].

## umaric acid esters F

FAE were fi  rst reported to be effective in psoriasis in 1959 [  1  ]. They have been licensed for the treatment of severe psoriasis in Germany since  1995  and  for  moderate  disease  since  2009  [  2  ].  FAE  are  not licensed in the UK but are nonetheless widely used. FAE appear to be ineffective in psoriatic arthritis, but they are effective in multiple sclerosis for which they are now licensed [  3  ].

These have multiple effects on immune function. They cause a reduction of glutathione with subsequent decreased Th1 cytokine production  including  IL-12  and  IL-23,  and  a  corresponding increase in Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 [  4  ]. FAE also cause altered Langerhans cell function and reduction in NFκ B production, with subsequent decreased TNFα and IL-8 levels [  5,6  ].

The commercially available preparation is Fumaderm ®   , which contains dimethylfumarate (the active ingredient) and three salts of  ethyl  hydrogen  fumarate.  Fumaderm is given according to a gradually  increasing  dosing  schedule  to  a  maximum  dose  of 240  mg  three  times  daily.  There  are  few  randomized  controlled trials assessing the effi  cacy of FAE but several large cohort studies have been published. Fumaderm given for 16 weeks has produced an improvement in PASI of between 50% and 80% [  7-10  ]. Long-term studies have suggested that the effi  cacy of Fumaderm continues to improve beyond 16 weeks with one large study of 984 patients reporting good responses in up to 80% of patients [  12  ]. The response to Fumaderm is heterogeneous and some patients will  achieve  long-term  control  on  small  doses  of  Fumaderm (&lt;120 mg daily) [  11  ].

Fumaderm  causes  gastrointestinal  upset,  usually  diarrhoea,  in about 60% of patients [  12  ].  Tolerance  develops in the majority of patients  allowing  dose  escalation.  Flushing  manifests  in  30%  of patients and may respond to aspirin or antihistamines. A transient eosinophilia may develop in some patients but the major issue is that FAE can cause lymphopenia in a signifi  cant number of patients. Current guidelines suggest dose reduction if the lymphocyte count decreases below 0.5 × 10 9 /L [  2  ].  If  the  lymphocyte  count  persists below this level then further dose reductions should be made until the count recovers or consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment. FAE do not seem to cause anaemia or thrombocytopenia [  2  ]. Despite the immunosuppressive nature of FAE there are few reports of opportunistic infections occurring while taking this drug. Reactivation of tuberculosis has been described in a patient who  had  received  Fumaderm  and  then  subsequently  received etanercept  [  13  ]. Progressive  multifocal  leucencephalopathy  has been described in two patients receiving FAE [  14,15  ]. Both of these patients had prolonged lymphopenia (&lt;0.5 × 10 9   /L) for 6 months or more. One case of Kaposi sarcoma has been described in a patient taking FAE. The lesions resolved on stopping the drug and restoration of normal lymphocyte function [  16  ]. FAE should be monitored in  a  similar  fashion  to  other  immunosuppressant  drugs.  Active infection should be excluded prior to starting the medication and caution should be exercised in using FAE in the setting of systemic malignancy. Prophylactic immunization with infl  uenza and pneumococcal vaccine should be part of routine management, as should screening for malignancies such as cervical cancer.

Fumaderm may cause proteinuria and this should be screened for  routinely.  Most  cases  of  proteinuria  are  stable  and  do  not require dose reduction and/or cessation of the drug. Proximal renal  tubule  dysfunction  may  occasionally  occur  and  Fanconi syndrome  has  been  reported  rarely  [  17  ].  Despite  recognized effects  on  renal  function,  progression  to  renal  failure  is  not reported in the literature. Guidelines recommend that renal failure is a contraindication to Fumaderm therapy [  2  ].

## Hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea)

Hydroxycarbamide is indicated predominantly in lymphoproliferative disorders but has been used occasionally in patients with psoriasis over the past 30 years [  1  ].

There are no randomized controlled trials of hydroxycarbamide in psoriasis. Given this lack of evidence and lack of clinical experience outside a few centres, it is used infrequently. In a retrospective study, Layton et  al reported  remission  in  52  of  80  patients  (61%) . with severe psoriasis prescribed 0.5-1.5 g daily [  2  ]. In another small study in which 31 patients with psoriasis received hydroxycarbamide 1-1.5 g daily for 36 weeks, 75% had at least a 35% improvement  in  PASI,  and  50%  had  a  70%  or  greater  reduction  in  PASI [  3  . There does not appear to be any benefi  t in increasing the dose ] beyond 1.5 g/day. Long-term satisfactory control can be achieved in patients with hydroxycarbamide for up to 10 years in some patients.

Hydroxycarbamide  is  cheap  and  appears  well  tolerated.  It can cause dose-dependent bone marrow toxicity and has a narrow therapeutic window. It is excreted via the kidneys so caution should be used in treating patients with impaired renal function [  1  . A raised mean corpuscular volume on full blood count tests is ] expected and in contrast to when this occurs in patients on methotrexate therapy, it is not a cause for concern. Hydroxycarbamide has been used in the treatment of HIV infection [  4  ] and may be a suitable choice of systemic treatment in psoriasis patients with HIV [  5  . Hydroxycarbamide has been reported to be associated with an ] increased incidence of actinic keratosis and SCC. The majority of these arise in patients with myeloproliferative disorders who are at increased risk of pre-malignant cutaneous lesions [  1  ].

## Apremilast

Apremilast  is  a  small  molecule  inhibitor  of  phosphodiesterase  4, which modulates pro-infl  ammatory mediator production. In a phase 2 clinical trial, PASI-75 at 16 weeks was achieved in 29% of patients receiving apremilast 20 mg twice daily compared with 6% in the placebo arm [  1  ]. The drug was generally well tolerated apart from mild nausea and diarrhoea. At the time of writing, apremilast has completed phase 3 clinical trials for psoriasis and has recently received a licence for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

## ofacitinib T

T ofacitinib, an oral inhibitor of Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK3 currently licensed for the treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, is in latestage development for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. In a phase 2 clinical trial in psoriasis, PASI-75 was achieved at 12 weeks in 40.8% of patients receiving 5 mg twice daily and 66.7% of those receiving 15 mg twice daily compared with 2% in the control arm [  1  . At the time of writing, tofacitinib has completed phase 3 clini-] cal trials for psoriasis.

## Ponesimod

Ponesimod is a modulator of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor  (S1PR1).  Antagonism  of  the  S1PR1  receptor  prevents  Tlymphocyte migration from secondary lymphoid tissue into the circulation. Ponesimod has been used successfully to treat multiple sclerosis and is in clinical development for psoriasis. A phase 2 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 326 patients with psoriasis produced PASI-75 at 16 weeks in 46% and 48.1%

of patients treated with ponesimod 20 mg or 40 mg orally daily, respectively, compared with 13.4% in the placebo arm ( P &lt;0.0001). There was an increased incidence of heart block and liver abnormalities in the treatment group compared to placebo [  1  ].

## Biological therapy

Biological  treatments  are  now  well  established  and  licensed  for moderate to severe psoriasis. Currently licensed treatments in this category are TNFα inhibitors (TNFi) and an IL-12/IL-23 p40 inhibitor. The evidence base for their short-term effi  cacy is robust, based on many well-designed randomized controlled trials. There are few direct comparisons between these agents [ 1 ] but indirect comparisons using network meta-analysis suggest marked variation in their short-term  effi  cacy  [  2  ].  The  optimal  sequence  of  biological  treatments is still  being  developed  as  longer  term  effi  cacy  and  safety data  emerge  [  3  ].  The  evidence  derived  from  clinical  trials  needs to be interpreted with caution in the clinical setting, due to factors such as the limited duration of the placebo-controlled phase of the trial, and the large number of exclusion criteria when recruiting to trials. Longer term safety data can more reliably be obtained from well-designed  treatment  registers  such  as  the  British  Association of Dermatologists Biologic Interventions Register [  4  ]. For instance, 30% of patients enrolled in a Spanish severe psoriasis register would have been ineligible for most randomized controlled trials (because of their age, pattern of psoriasis or co-morbidities) and this ineligible group was at increased risk of serious adverse events [  5  ]. Registers, or networks of registers, are also more powerful to detect rare adverse events, such as the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy that developed in patients exposed to efalizumab, a drug licensed  for  use  following  a  full  drug  development  programme [  6-9  ] and subsequently withdrawn from the market [  10  ].

## TNFα inhibitors

The introduction of TNFi has revolutionized the management of severe psoriasis. They have the advantages, compared with previous conventional treatments, of a different mechanism of action and as a consequence a different safety profi  le, high response rates (Table   35.6  ) and effi  cacy when other approaches have failed. Currently,  three  TNFi  are  licensed  for  this  indication;  adalimumab, etanercept and infl  iximab. Although they share the same therapeutic target, these agents differ in many respects including their dosing, route of administration, mechanism of action, speed of onset, retention  on  treatment,  immunogenicity  and  safety.  In  Europe, the  marketing  authorization  of  each  agent  for  the    indication  of

ASI, Psoriasis Area Severity Index. P

psoriasis  is  the  same,  being  limited  to  moderate/severe  disease when  other  treatments  (methotrexate,  ciclosporin  and  phototherapy) have been ineffective, or are contraindicated. Their use is often further restricted because of their greater cost than traditional systemic treatments.

As has often been the case in the development of new treatments for psoriasis, the potential effi  cacy of TNFi was fi  rst suspected in 2000,  when  infl  iximab  (a  chimeric  human-murine  monoclonal antibody with affi  nity for TNFα ) was coincidentally found to dramatically  improve  the  psoriasis  of  a  woman  who  was  receiving the drug for the treatment of Crohn disease [  1  ]. Subsequent randomized trials confi  rmed the rapid onset of action and high effi  cacy of infl  iximab in psoriasis compared with placebo [  2,3  ,    ]. Infl  iximab 4 also has effi  cacy in psoriatic nail disease [  4  ] and psoriatic arthritis [  5  . In contrast to the other TNFi, the drug is given by intravenous ] infusion and dose is based on body weight (5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2 and 6 and then every 8 weeks). A response is often seen after the first infusion, and after an induction phase of three infusions 80% of patients achieve PASI-75 and 57% achieve PASI-90 compared with 3% and 1% with placebo, respectively [ 4 . This rapid and reliable ] response makes the drug particularly suitable in urgent circumstances such as erythrodermic psoriasis and generalized pustular psoriasis [ 6 . In the maintenance phase, effi  cacy is maintained to ,7] 50 weeks in randomized controlled trials in the majority of cases [    ] 4 although persistence of response is lower with intermittent dosing [  8  .  Persistence on infl  iximab at 4 years was reported in 70% of a ] registry cohort of 144 Danish psoriasis patients [  9  ]. Antidrug antibodies (ADA) have been reported in a high proportion of individuals treated with infl  iximab, and correlate with lower serum drug levels, loss of effi  cacy and the development of infusion reactions [  8 ,10  ]. Higher serum levels of infl  iximab and a reduced incidence of ADA have been reported when infl  iximab is prescribed in combination  with  methotrexate  [  11  ].  Although  combination  therapy with methotrexate is a licensing recommendation for infl  iximab in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, this has not been prospectively studied in plaque psoriasis.

Etanercept, a fully human soluble TNFα receptor fusion protein that binds and neutralizes TNFα ,    in  psoriasis is in three phase 3  trials  [ 12 ,13,14  ].  Response  is  of  slower  onset  than  with  infl  iximab, becoming evident after 4-8 weeks of treatment [  13  ]. PASI-75 was achieved at 12 weeks in 34% and 47-49% of patients receiving 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg twice weekly and PASI-90 in 11-12% and 21% of patients at these same doses [  14  ]. The number responding to treatment continues to rise up to 24 months at which point 59% of patients will have achieved PASI-75 with the higher dose of treatment [ 12 . Open-label extensions of the phase 3 trials have ] revealed the continuing effi  cacy of etanercept in initial responders for up to 4 years, with some loss of effi  cacy between 1 and 2 years [  15  ]. A subsequent randomized controlled trial has demonstrated PASI-75  at  12  weeks  in  37.5%  of  patients  treated  with  etanercept 50 mg weekly [  16  ]. The licensed dose of etanercept is 25 mg administered twice weekly or 50 mg administered once weekly. Alternatively, 50 mg given twice weekly may be used for up to 12 weeks followed, if necessary, by a dose of 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly, although this dose has not been approved by  NICE  on  pharmacoeconomic  grounds.  Etanercept  has  also been  found  to  be  an  effective  treatment  in  paediatric  psoriasis, for which it is licensed in resistant moderate to severe disease. In a randomized controlled trial of 211 patients with psoriasis aged 4-17 years, etanercept 0.8 mg/kg body weight produced PASI-75 at week 12 in 57% of patients compared with 11% of those receiving placebo [  17  ]. Response has been maintained for up to 96 weeks [  18  ]. Etanercept has been combined safely with phototherapy [  19  ], acitretin  [  20  ]  or  methotrexate  [  21  ]  in  short-term  studies  of  adult patients and in each instance the combination is of greater effi  cacy than etanercept alone.

Adalimumab (a fully human monoclonal antibody with affi  nity for TNFα ) has demonstrated high effi  cacy in psoriasis and is also licensed for psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. The onset of treatment response in psoriasis is rapid, being signifi  cant at 2 weeks and maximal between weeks 12 and 16. In phase 3 trials, PASI-75 and PASI-90 at 16 weeks was seen in 71-80% and 45-51%, respectively, of patients receiving the licensed dose (adalimumab 80 mg at week 0 then 40 mg every other week beginning at week 1) [  22,23  ] although higher response rates are seen with the unlicensed dose of 80 mg weekly [  24  ]. Open-label extensions of phase 3 trials have confi  rmed continuing effi  cacy of up to 3 years in  most  initial  responders  [  25  ]. Adalimumab  has  shown  greater effi  cacy  after  16  weeks of treatment than methotrexate (7.5 mg/ week initial dose increasing to a maximum of 25 mg/week as tolerated) [  23  ]. Patients on adalimumab therapy may develop ADA, which are associated with reduced serum levels and reduced effi  cacy. In one small study, serum adalimumab levels at week 4 were predictive of effi  cacy at 6 months [  26  ].

## L-12/IL-23 p40 inhibitors I

Ustekinumab is a fully human IgG 1 κ monoclonal antibody against the p40 subunit that is common to both IL-12 and IL-23. Its effi  cacy in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis was confi  rmed in two separate randomized controlled trials in 2008 [  1,2  ] leading to market authorization for this indication in many countries. In the fi  rst of these, PASI-75 was achieved at week 12 in 67% and 66% of those receiving ustekinumab 90 mg or 45 mg, respectively, at week 0, 4 and 12, as against 3% in the placebo arm [  1  ]. In the second pivotal trial, PASI-75 was achieved at week 12 in 76% and 67% of those receiving ustekinumab 90 mg and 45 mg, respectively, as against 4% in those randomized to placebo [  2  ]. In this latter trial, 69% of partial responders (defi  ned as &gt;PASI-50 but &lt;PASI-75) to ustekinumab 90 mg every 12 weeks achieved PASI-75 at week 52 when the injection frequency was increased to every 8 weeks [  2  ]. There is  evidence for reduced effi  cacy in patients with increased body weight, in association with reduced serum drug levels [  3  ] leading to a licensed dose of ustekinumab 45 mg at weeks 0, 4 and then every 12 weeks in those who weigh less than 100 kg, and 90 mg at the same dosing interval in those who weigh more than 100 kg. Subsequent randomized placebo-controlled trials have confi  rmed the  effi  cacy  of  ustekinumab  in  a  Chinese  population  [  4  ].  Ustekinumab has greater short-term effi  cacy than etanercept 50 mg twice weekly [  5  ]. Early experience of ustekinumab use in the UK/Ireland and Denmark has confi  rmed effi  cacy in patients in routine clinical practice, many of whom had failed to respond to TNFα inhibitors [  6,7  ]. There is preliminary evidence of an increased response rate to  ustekinumab  in  patients  who  are  HLA-C:06:02  positive  [  8,9  ].

Safety data from open-label extensions of the original phase 3 trials reveal no signifi  cant cumulative safety signals in up to 5 years of  follow-up [  10  ]  although  there  is  unresolved  controversy  concerning a possible short-term increase in adverse cardiovascular events with anti-IL-12/IL-23 approaches [  11-13  ].

Ustekinumab also has activity against various aspects of psoriatic arthritis (peripheral and axial disease, dactylitis, enthesitis) [  14  ] and Crohn disease [  15  ].

## L-17 inhibitors I

There  are  six  cytokines  in  the  IL-17  cytokine  family,  IL-17  A-F and fi  ve receptors IL-17 A-E. IL-17A, -C and -F mRNA levels are elevated in psoriasis plaques and increased numbers of IL-17Apositive  cells  are  found  in  involved  psoriasis  skin  compared  to controls [ 1 ]. The cellular source of IL-17 in psoriasis includes lymphocytes but also innate immune cells such as neutrophils, mast cells and innate lymphoid cells [  2  ]. There are currently three IL-17 inhibitors in late-stage development for the treatment of psoriasis (brodalumab, ixekizumab and secukinumab). Secukinumab and ixekizumab target IL-17A, whereas brodalumab targets a subunit of the IL-17 receptor (IL-17RA), and thereby inhibits IL-17A, IL17F and IL-E (also known as IL-25). Each appears to be rapidly and profoundly effective. At the time of writing, phase 3 clinical trials of these three agents have been completed but only published for secukinumab.

Brodalumab, a fully human IL-17RA monoclonal antibody, has been evaluated in a phase 2 clinical trial. Given at a dose of 70 mg, 140 mg or 210 mg subcutaneously on weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 10 weeks or 280 mg subcutaneously at day 1, week 4 and week 8, produced PASI-75 at 12 weeks in 77% of the 140 mg group and 82% of the 210 mg group compared to none with placebo. PASI-90 was reached in 72% of the 140 mg and 75% of the 210 mg group. Signifi  cant neutropenia was reported in two cases in the 210 mg group. Overall the drug was well tolerated with few adverse events noted [  3  ].

xekizumab, a humanized anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody, has I been evaluated in a phase 2 clinical trial. Given at a dose of 10 mg, 25 mg, 75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks produced PASI-75 at 12 weeks in 82.1% in the 150 mg group, 82.8% in the 75 mg group and 76.7% in the 25 mg group. PASI-90 was achieved by 71.4%, 58.6% and 50.0% of patients in the 150 mg, 75 mg and 25 mg groups, respectively. PASI-100 was achieved by 39.3% in the 150 mg group and 37.9% of the 75 mg group [  4  ]. Responses were generally sustained in a 52-week openlabel extension to the trial [  5  ].

Secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to IL-17A, has been evaluated in two phase 3 randomized clinical trials [    ]. 6 Given at a dose of 300 mg or 150 mg (administered once weekly for 5 weeks, then every 4 weeks) produced PASI-75 at 12 weeks in 77.1-88.6% and 67-71.6%, respectively. PASI-90 was achieved by 54.2-59.2%, and 39.1-41.9% of patients in the 300 mg and 150 mg groups, respectively. PASI-100 was achieved by 24.1-28.6% of the 300 mg group and 12.8-14.4% of the 150 mg group. Both doses were  more  effective  at  12  weeks  than  etanercept  50  mg  twice weekly in a head-to-head comparison. Secukinumab has also been reported as effective in psoriatic arthritis [  7  ] (see p. 35.46  ).

Anti IL-23 p19 inhibitors (guselkumab and tildrakizumab) are in clinical development for psoriasis [  8,9  ].

## USTULAR PSORIASIS P

## ntroduction and general description I

Neutrophil accumulation in the epidermis is a histological feature of all types of psoriasis, but in clin  ical practice the term 'pustular psoriasis' is reserved for those forms of the disease in which macroscopic pustules appear. Pustules may be provoked within plaques of psoriasis as part of an unstable phase of the disease: this  is  better  considered  'plaque  psoriasis  with  pustules'  rather than a form of pustular psoriasis per se (Figure   35.35  ). Under these circumstances, pustules can often more readily be seen by dermoscopy (Figure   35.36  a,b).

Pustular psoriasis consists of a clinically heterogeneous group of diseases and their place within the spectrum of psoriatic disease is being refi  ned as their molecular genetic basis is further resolved. It is useful to separate these conditions into localized and generalized pustular psoriasis but there is clinical overlap and recent molecular genetic studies have revealed mutations in IL36RN at varying  frequencies  in  both  localized  and  generalized  pustular psoriasis [ 1 . In the localized forms, the disease is usually confi  ned ] largely to the hands and feet and tends to be chronic. In the generalized forms, the whole body may be involved and the course is subacute, acute or even fulminating and life threatening.

Pending a full aetiological and molecular classifi  cation of pustular psoriasis, a conventional classifi  cation is as follows.

## 1  Generalized pustular psoriasis:

Clinical variants (based on morphology and natural history):

- (i)  Acute generalized pustular psoriasis (von Zumbusch).

## Generalized pustular psoriasis

## Defi  nition

Generalized  pustular  psoriasis  is  a  disease  in  which  an  acute, subacute or occasionally chronic eruption has generalized sterile

pustulosis as its central feature. It is a rare and extreme form of psoriasis in which all the main pathological features of the disease are  accentuated.  Generalized pustular psoriasis is clinically heterogeneous in its age at onset, precipitants, severity and natural history. Several overlapping clinical subgroups are recognized, as outlined later. There is a relationship between these entities and plaque  psoriasis,  as  some  patients  may  have  phases  of  plaque psoriasis before or after the generalized pustular psoriasis, but in others generalized pustular psoriasis occurs as the sole phenotype without plaque psoriasis at any time.

## Epidemiology

## ncidence and prevalence I

Generalized pustular psoriasis is rare. The annual incidence and prevalence in a French population has been estimated as at least 0.64 and 1.76 per million, respectively [  1  ]. The prevalence in Japan has been estimated at 7.46 per million [  2  ].

## Age at onset

The incidence peaks between 40 and 59 years of age, but infantile and juvenile cases are also reported [  1  ]. The age at onset tends to be earlier in those with pure generalized pustular psoriasis without plaque psoriasis [  2,3  ].

## Gender

n  some  published  series,  women  outnumber  men  in  a  ratio  of I about 2 to 1 [  1,2  , 3 , but this is not consistent in all cohorts [  4  ]. ]

## Associated diseases

nfl  ammatory polyarthritis is common. In one series, one-third of I patients were eventually affected [  1  ]. The metabolic syndrome is also frequently associated; in one large series, the reported co-morbidities  included  obesity  (43%),  hypertension  (26%),  dyslipidaemia (26%) and diabetes (24%) [    ]. 2

## Pathophysiology

## Predisposing factors

Environmental  factors  that  may  trigger  or  exacerbate  generalized pustular psoriasis include infection, topical or systemic treatments, psychological stress, pregnancy and hypocalcaemia. Provocation is most obvious in the acute forms. Von Zumbusch's original description  was  provoked  by  irritating  topical  therapy  [  1  ].  Coal  tar  and dithranol  may  provoke  pustulation  if  injudiciously  applied  when the disease is unstable [  2,3  ]. The most important drug provocation is by corticosteroids. There is substantial evidence that withdrawal of systemic corticosteroid therapy can precipitate generalized pustular psoriasis and topical therapy with potent corticosteroids under occlusion  has  also  been  implicated  [  2  ,  4  ].  There  are  reports  of  the induction of generalized pustular psoriasis on withdrawal of ciclosporin [  5,6  ]. Other systemic drugs have also occasionally been implicated including terbinafi  ne [  7-9  ], propranolol [  10  ], bupropion [  11  ], lithium  [  12  ],  phenylbutazone  [  13  ],  salicylates  [  14  ]  and  potassium iodide [  15  ]. Some of these instances may now be considered to represent acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), which can be diffi  cult to distinguish in patients known to have psoriasis [  16  ].

Viral  or  bacterial  infections  are  common  exacerbating  factors, reported  in  12  of  16  patients  with  known  generalized  pustular psoriasis in one series [  17  ]. Many individuals report deterioration at times of psychological stress [  18  ]. Hypocalcaemia may arise as a consequence of generalized pustular psoriasis, but triggering of active disease by hypocalcaemia caused by hypoparathyroidism has also been reported [  19,20  ]. Generalized pustular psoriasis triggered by pregnancy is discussed on p. 35.35  .

## Histopathology

n  acute  generalized  pustular  psoriasis,  there  is  intense  infl  amI mation.  The  earliest  infi  ltrate  is  lymphocytic.  Intense  papillary and epidermal oedema cause spongiosis. The arrival of masses of neutrophils  leads  to  spongiform  pustule  formation  (Kogoj)  and abscesses  that  quickly  become  macroscopic.  There  is  acanthosis with elongation of rete ridges. The stratum corneum soon becomes parakeratotic  and  the  subcorneal  pustule  is  shed  as  epidermal turnover is accelerated. Similar features are seen in subacute as in acute patterns but in a less intense form.

## Genetic and environmental risk factors

n a series of 35 Asian adults with generalized pustular psoriasis, I 29% had a family history of plaque psoriasis and 11% of generalized pustular psoriasis [  1  ]. Multiplex generalized pustular psoriasis  families  with  parental  consanguinity  have  been  reported, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance in some families [  2,3  ]. Deleterious germline mutations in IL36RN have been reported in familial [  2  ] and sporadic [  3  ] generalized pustular psoriasis in populations from UK, Germany, Tunisia, Malaysia, China and Japan [  4-8  ].  Mutations  differ  between  populations,  with  evidence of a founder effect; in Europeans the commonest mutation in IL36RN results in the substitution p.Ser113Leu, and is present in 0.03% of the healthy European population [  8  ]. The same mutation is seen in generalized pustular psoriasis (von Zumbusch), acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau and to a lesser extent palmoplantar pustulosis [  8  ]. In a North African population p.Leu27Pro was present in the homozygous state in all individuals with generalized pustular psoriasis,  including  infantile  and  juvenile  cases,  and  in  patients diagnosed as impetigo herpetiformis [  2  ]. There is some evidence for  genotype-phenotype  correlation  as IL36RN mutations  are present  in  a  lower  proportion  of  generalized  pustular  psoriasis patients with concomitant or prior plaque psoriasis than in those with 'pure' generalized pustular psoriasis; in Japan the commonest mutation (p.Arg10*) was present in the homozygous state or as a compound heterozygote in about 80% of pure generalized pustular psoriasis but only 10% of generalized pustular psoriasis with prior plaque psoriasis [  6  ]. Generalized pustular psoriasis patients with IL36RN mutations are also more likely to have early-onset disease, and a systemic infl  ammatory response [  9  ]. Plaque psoriasis risk alleles in HLA are more likely to be present in the phenotype of generalized pustular psoriasis with plaque psoriasis [  6  ,  10  ].

IL36RN encodes the IL-36 receptor antagonist (IL36-Ra), which is  expressed  primarily  in  the  skin  and  is  an  antagonist  of  three pro-infl  ammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family (IL-36 α β , and γ ). These  cytokines  activate  signalling  pathways,  such  as  NF-kB and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and are interregulated by Th17 cytokines and TNFα [  11  ]. IL-36 cytokines are also

overexpressed in the skin of plaque psoriasis, consistent with the concept that abnormal IL-36 signalling has an important role in the establishment of cutaneous infl  ammation, but presumably by a different mechanism than in generalized pustular psoriasis, as mutations in IL36RN have not been identifi  ed in a large cohort of patients with plaque psoriasis [  12  ].

There are occasional reports of mutations in CARD14 in  generalized  pustular  psoriasis,  particularly  in  those  with  coexistent plaque psoriasis [  7  ,  13  , 14 . ]

## Clinical features

## History

In the acute stage, there is a burning painful sensation in the skin, usually without a prodrome. Fever and malaise accompany the development of waves of pustules. About a third of patients complain of arthralgia [    ]. 1

## Clinical variants (based on morphology and natural history)

## Acute generalized pustular psoriasis (von Zumbusch)

This pattern of generalized pustular psoriasis is named after Leo von  Zumbusch,  who  described  a  brother  and  sister  who  experienced repeated waves of acute erythema and pustulation over many years, sometimes provoked by topical treatment [    ]. This is the most 1 acute and severe form of generalized pustular psoriasis and is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. It may occur as the sole phenotype or arise following plaque psoriasis, acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau or palmoplantar pustulosis. It may manifest only in pregnancy when it has been referred to as impetigo herpetiformis, and may be the phenotype in infantile and juvenile generalized pustular psoriasis. Diagnostic criteria have been proposed consisting of recurrent episodes of fever with general malaise, multiple isolated sterile  pustules,  laboratory  abnormalities  (leukocytosis,  elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein), supported by Kogoj's spongiform pustules on histopathology [  2  ].

Two main groups have been distinguished [  3  ]. In one, plaque psoriasis of early onset develops into pustular psoriasis often after many  years,  and  sometimes  provoked  by  corticosteroid  withdrawal or other external factors. In the other, which is less closely related to plaque psoriasis, the onset of pustular psoriasis arises de novo ,  sometimes provoked by infection. It may be atypical initially, restricted to acral or fl  exural sites but rapidly and spontaneously progresses to the generalized pustular form.

n either form, the eruption may be ushered in by a sensation of I burning in the skin, which becomes dry and tender. These warning signs - not always present - are followed by an abrupt onset of high fever  and  severe  malaise.  Pre-existing  lesions  become  fi  ery  and develop pinpoint pustules (Figure   35.37  ). Sheets of erythema and pustulation spread to involve previously unaffected skin, the fl  exures and genital regions being particularly involved (Figure   35.38  ). Any confi  guration or variety of pustular exanthem may occur, for instance isolated pustules, lakes of pus, circinate lesions, plaques of erythema with pustular collarettes or a generalized erythroderma. Waves of pustulation may succeed each other, subsiding into exfoliation of the dried pustules.

The nails become thickened or separated by subungual lakes of pus. The buccal mucosa and tongue may be involved, the lesions on the latter being clinically and histologically indistinguishable from  geographic  tongue.  Remission  may  occur  within  days  or weeks, the psoriasis returning to its normal state, or erythroderma develops. Relapses are common.

## Subacute annular generalized pustular psoriasis

Annular and other patterned lesions may be seen in acute generalized pustular psoriasis (von Zumbusch), but are more characteristic

of the rarer subacute or chronic forms of widespread pustular psoriasis [  1-3  ]. This is a common presentation of generalized pustular psoriasis in infancy and early childhood. Lesions begin as discrete areas of erythema, which become raised and oedematous. Slow centrifugal  spread  may  mimic  erythema  annulare  centrifugum  [  4,5  ]. Pustules appear peripherally on the crest of the advancing edge, become desiccated and leave a trailing fringe of scale as the lesion slowly advances (Figure   35.39  a,b). There are generally no systemic symptoms.

These extend centrifugally, drying in the centre, or form plaques, which  may  become  widespread. As  individual  areas  heal,  they leave a reddish brown pigmentation. The tongue, buccal mucosa and even the oesophagus may be involved, with circinate or erosive lesions following short-lived pustules.

Some authors have separated a related pattern, well described by Lapière as recurrent circinate erythematous psoriasis [  6,7  ]. It may occur alone (in the complete absence at any stage of recognizable psoriasis) or as a phase in what is clearly generalized pustular  psoriasis.  Linear forms of pustular psoriasis are occasionally observed within the context of more generalized pustulosis [  8,9  ].

## Other specifi  ed forms of generalized pustular psoriasis (based on age or precipitants)

## Acute generalized pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (impetigo herpetiformis)

mpetigo herpetiformis is a rare entity fi  rst described by Hebra in I 1872 [  1  ],  37  years  before  the  report  of  generalized  pustular psoriasis by von Zumbusch, and the relationship between these diseases has generated some controversy subsequently [  2-4  ]. Recent molecular genetic studies support the view that impetigo herpetiformis represents generalized pustular psoriasis triggered by or occurring in pregnancy [    ]. 5

Onset is usually in the last trimester of pregnancy, but may be earlier, and has been recorded in the fi  rst month of pregnancy [  6  ] and in the fi  rst  day of the puerperium [  7  ]. The disease tends to persist until the child is born, and occasionally long afterwards. Essentially, the features are of generalized pustular psoriasis, usually of fl  exural onset and with a marked tendency to symmetry, and  sometimes  grouping  of  areas  of  pustulation.  The  eruption usually  starts  in  the  inguino-genital  region  and  other  fl  exures, with minute pustules arising on an acutely infl  amed area of skin.

Constitutional disturbance  is characteristic  ally severe with fever, and death may occur due to cardiac or renal failure. Delirium,  diarrhoea,  vomiting  and  tetany  have  been  described.  The more severe and longstanding the disease, the greater the risks of placental insuffi  ciency leading to stillbirth, neonatal death or fetal abnormalities [  3,4  ,  8  ].

Characteristically, the disease recurs in subsequent pregnancies [  3 ,8  ].  Recurrence  has  been  described  in  up  to  nine  pregnancies, and on subsequent use of oral contraceptives [  3  ]. In one case, the disease continued unabated despite termination of the pregnancy [  6  . ]

## nfantile and juvenile generalized pustular psoriasis I

All forms of pustular psoriasis are rare in childhood accounting for about 1% of severe psoriasis in this age group [  1-3  ]. In a case series of 104 patients with generalized pustular psoriasis, only fi  ve were children [  4  ]. Although generalized pustular psoriasis can begin at any age in childhood, in over 25% of cases onset has been in the first year of life [  5  ]. The disease may begin in the fi  rst few weeks of life and two cases of congenital generalized pustular psoriasis have been described [  6  ].

When  the  onset  is  in  infancy,  systemic  symptoms  are  often absent and spontaneous remissions may occur [  5  ]. In at least onethird of infantile cases, a history of an eruption diagnosed as seborrhoeic  dermatitis,  napkin  dermatitis  or  sudden-onset  napkin psoriasis is obtained [  7-9  ]. Pustular psoriasis may be localized to flexural areas, for instance the neck, for long periods [  10  ]. More severe forms with fever and toxicity do occur, necessitating active treatment.

The majority of children are aged 2-10 years at onset. The disease may be of von Zumbusch pattern, but annular and circinate forms are  more  common in this  age  group  [  9  ,  11  ].  Onset  of  von

Zumbusch-type  generalized  pustular  psoriasis  may  be  abrupt with  toxicity  and  a  rapidly  developing  erythroderma.  Attacks often settle within a few days, but repeated waves of infl  ammation may follow. In older children, the disease resembles that in the adult and may be of any of the recognized patterns.

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis is that of widespread non-follicular pustules. In the acute phase, the presence of fever, leukocytosis and elevated infl  ammatory markers may lead to a mistaken diagnosis of systemic infection, sometimes leading to a counterproductive discontinuation  of  immunosuppressive  treatment. AGEP  is  perhaps the most diffi  cult differential diagnosis, occurring as an acute, spontaneously healing reaction to drugs, usually antibiotics [  1  ]. It is probable that some cases previously reported as drug-induced generalized pustular psoriasis would now be classifi  ed as having AGEP. Subcorneal pustular dermatosis of Sneddon and Wilkinson remains a controversial entity [  2,3  ]. In infantile acropustulosis, the disease does not become generalized and is not associated with constitutional disturbance [  4,5  ]. The distinction between generalized pustular psoriasis and pustular lesions in reactive arthritis is probably academic. Acute pemphigus foliaceus can mimic subacute generalized pustular psoriasis, but histological and immunofl   uorescence testing will distinguish between them. The wasting, glossitis  and  anaemia  associated  with  the  migratory  necrolytic eruption of glucagonoma should allow differentiation. Occasionally,  the  bowel  bypass  syndrome  [  6,7  ],  Sweet  syndrome  [  8  ]  and Behçet  syndrome  will  cause  diffi  culty.  Staphyloderma,  rampant impetigo  or  candidiasis  in  the  immunosuppressed  should  be remembered.

## Classifi  cation of severity

The  severity  of  generalized  pustular  psoriasis  varies  greatly between  patients  and  over  time.  There  is  no  validated  severity scoring  system  although  the  activity  of  disease  at  a  given  time point  has  been  categorized  as  mild,  moderate  or  severe  based upon the extent of erythema and pustulation, fever and laboratory abnormalities (leukocytosis, elevated infl  ammatory markers, low serum calcium and albumin) [  1  ].

## Complications and co-morbidities

In the acute phase, the affected individual is systemically unwell. Hypovolaemia and oligaemia can cause acute kidney injury [  1  ]. Hypoalbuminaemia in the acute episode may be profound, perhaps because of a sudden loss of plasma protein into the tissues [  2    and  intestinal  malabsorption [  3,4  ].  Hypocalcaemia may arise ] as  a  consequence  of  the  hypoalbuminaemia  and  malabsorption [  3  .  The  absorption  of  therapeutic  drugs  may  also  be  impaired. ] Abnormalities of liver enzymes are common, occurring in up to a half of patients during the acute episode [  5  ]. Cholestatic jaundice may arise as a consequence of neutrophilic cholangitis [  6,7  ]. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (psoriasis-associated aseptic pneumonitis) is rare but possibly underreported - 12 cases were identified in the world literature when reviewed in 2011 [  8  ]. It presents with rapidly deteriorating dyspnoea and hypoxia in the absence of  infection  and responds to oral corticosteroids. Staphylococcal infection may complicate generalized pustular psoriasis, usually because of cross-infection. Staphylococcus aureus may occasionally be grown from pustules and rarely from blood cultures. If generalized pustular psoriasis lasts more than a few days, hair loss may follow from all areas of the body. Telogen effl  uvium may follow 2-3 months after the height of the illness. Amyloidosis is a rare late complication [  9  ].

## Disease course and prognosis

There is a paucity of data on the long-term prognosis of generalized pustular psoriasis. Von Zumbusch's male patient survived many acute episodes over a number of years [  1  ]. However, in the absence of effective treatment, death can occur in the acute stage. Ryan and Baker reported on the prognosis in 155 patients with all types of generalized pustular psoriasis managed over 40 years ago [  2  ]. Thirty-four of 106 patients followed up had died, and 26 of these deaths were attributable to the disease or its treatment. By 2006, in a cohort of 99 French patients, the mortality rate had declined to 2% [  3  ]. This apparent reduction in mortality has been attributed to effective treatment, particularly the introduction of oral retinoids and reduced use of oral corticosteroids. The prognosis is good for subacute annular and circinate generalized pustular psoriasis and, as a consequence, for generalized pustular psoriasis in infants and children [  4  ].

Amongst generalized pustular psoriasis (von Zumbusch) the prognosis is better when there is a clear trigger, exemplifi  ed by generalized  pustular  psoriasis  of  pregnancy  [  5  ].  Generalized pustular psoriasis developing from acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau seems to have the worst prognosis, seven out of 11 patients having died and a further one remaining severely disabled [  2  ]. To some extent, this particularly poor outlook refl  ects the  age  at  onset  of  these  patients,  who  were  predominantly elderly.

## nvestigations I

The  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  and  C-reactive  protein  are usually  raised.  There  may  be  an  absolute  lymphopenia  at  the onset  of  generalized  pustular  psoriasis.  A  polymorphonuclear leukocytosis quickly follows. Plasma albumin, zinc and calcium may be abnormally low. Malabsorption may explain some of these ndings. fi

## Management

The  treatment  of  acute  generalized  pustular  psoriasis  often requires in-patient dermatological management with topical and usually systemic drug therapy, general supportive measures and removal of possible provocative factors. Excessive heat loss must be prevented by maintaining an adequate ambient temperature. Fluid intake should be increased so that the daily urine volume remains adequate. Tar or dithranol can be withdrawn abruptly, but removal of potent topical corticosteroids requires more care. The application of serially diluted topical corticosteroids over several days may be the safest course, and is preferable to substitution of oral or parenteral corticosteroids, however temporary. Infection, where  present,  should  be  treated  rigorously  with  the  appropriate antibiotics. In rare circumstances, when generalized pustular psoriasis in pregnancy is threatening maternal life, termination or early delivery may be indicated.

f  there  is  no  immediate metabolic threat in acute generalized I pustular psoriasis, and generally in subacute forms, initial treatment should be conservative. This is particularly so in infancy and childhood. Bed rest in hospital, mild sedation, bland local applications with fl  uid and protein replacement may promote spontaneous reversion to a quieter erythrodermic psoriasis or even plaque psoriasis.  This  approach  is  particularly  apt  if  a  provocative  factor has been at play. However, such a course has to be weighed against the risk of repeated waves of pustulation that may exhaust the  patient,  and  the  hypostatic  and  thrombotic  hazards  of  prolonged bed rest, particularly in the elderly.

## Topical treatment

Often, bland  creams  or  lotions  are  best.  Weak  corticosteroid creams may be helpful in subacute forms. Tar and dithranol are contraindicated.

## Systemic therapy

Most  cases  of  generalized  pustular  psoriasis  require  systemic therapy but the quality of the evidence for specifi  c interventions is understandably poor, given the rarity of these diseases. Guidelines for the management of generalized pustular psoriasis were published in Japan in 2003 [  1  ] and for pustular psoriasis in the USA by the National Psoriasis Foundation in 2012 [ 2 .  Oral  retinoids ] are  probably  the  treatment  of  choice.  In  385  Japanese  patients with generalized pustular psoriasis, acitretin was reported to be effective in more than 80% of cases, and was more effective than oral corticosteroids, methotrexate or ciclosporin [  3  ]. In a survey of French dermatology departments in 2005, 89% used acitretin as first line treatment of choice and the authors observed that their widespread  introduction  as  treatment  for  generalized  pustular psoriasis correlated with a reduction in mortality of the disease [  4  ]. High doses of acitretin (1 mg/kg/day) should be given for rapid control in severe generalized pustular psoriasis and lower doses of 0.5-0.75 mg/kg/day may be suffi  cient in milder disease and to maintain remission [  1  ]. Acitretin should not be used for generalized pustular psoriasis of pregnancy.

Rapid control  of  generalized  pustular  psoriasis  can  been achieved with high-dose ciclosporin and remission maintained with a lower dose [  5-7  ]. Doses in the range of 3.5-5 mg/kg/day are  recommended  [  1  ].  Methotrexate  is  effective  in  about  60% of  patients  but  has  a  relatively  slow  onset  of  action  [  3  ,  8  ].  Oral methotrexate needs to be dosed with caution in those with severe disease, because of concerns about erratic absorption. Parenteral administration should be considered. An oral dose of 0.2-0.4 mg/ kg/week should suffi  ce, starting at the lower end of the range. If the patient is very ill, renal function should be monitored frequently  if  methotrexate  overdosage  is  to  be  avoided.  Methotrexate has been used with success in children with generalized pustular psoriasis [  9  ]. Oral or parenteral corticosteroids should generally be avoided and used only when urgent control of complications is needed (e.g. acute respiratory distress syndrome) or when other drugs are contraindicated, for instance in pregnancy. The short-term effects of prednisolone (30-40 mg/day) are good, but serious relapses are liable to occur as the dosage is reduced unless  another  form  of  therapy  (e.g.  acitretin,  TNFi)  is  given simultaneously [  8  ,  10  ].

Experience with the use of TNFi in generalized pustular psoriasis is increasing, supported by case reports and small case series particularly  in  the  use  of  infl  iximab  [  11-18  ].  The  rapid  onset  of action makes this modality of treatment an attractive option for fulminant generalized pustular psoriasis. Interesting recent developments that need further evaluation include IL-1 blockade with anakinra [  19,20  ] and granulocyte/monocyte adsorption apheresis [  21,22  ].

## ntroduction and general description I

The relationship of palmoplantar pustulosis to plaque psoriasis is controversial [  1  ]. The two diseases occur together more frequently than expected by chance (between 18% and 24% of patients with palmoplantar pustulosis develop plaque psoriasis [  2,3  ])  but  typically  palmoplantar  pustulosis  occurs  in  isolation.  This,  and  the absence of the genetic associations characteristic of plaque psoriasis in such patients, indicate that palmoplantar pustulosis represents a distinct entity, within the spectrum of psoriatic skin diseases.

## Epidemiology

## ncidence and prevalence I

The prevalence is estimated at 0.01-0.05% of the general population [  1 . ]

## Age at onset

The onset may be in early adult life, but peaks between the ages of 30 and 50 years, later than for plaque psoriasis [  1  ].

## Gender

Many more women than men are affected, in a ratio of about 5 : 1 [  1,2  ].

## Associated diseases

A  signifi  cant  prevalence  of  autoimmune  thyroid  disease  and the presence of thyroid antibodies have been found in association with palmoplantar pustulosis [  1  ]. Some patients also have antigliadin  antibodies  -  in  one  Swedish  study  of  123  patients, 18% had antigliadin antibodies and some of these experienced an improvement in palmoplantar pustulosis on a gluten-free diet [  2  . A greater tendency to develop diabetes was found in a Japa-] nese study [  3  ]. Palmoplantar pustulosis is the commonest cutaneous manifestation of a group of rare diseases characterized by sterile  osteitis  or  synovitis  known as SAPHO syndrome (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis; syn. pustulotic arthro-osteitis) [  4,5  ]. This most frequently involves the anterior chest wall but may also involve the axial skeleton. It is thought that chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, which most frequently affects the femur and tibia, may represent a childhood form of SAPHO syndrome.

## Pathophysiology

## Predisposing factors

Palmoplantar pustulosis usually starts without obvious provocation. Cigarette smoking has been reported to be strongly associated - more than 90% of patients with palmoplantar pustulosis are  current  or  previous  smokers  [  1  ]  and  in  some  instances  the disease improves in those who manage to stop smoking [  2  ]. Palmoplantar  pustulosis  is  one  of  the  commonest  morphologies seen in patients who develop psoriasiform rashes on exposure to TNFi for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn disease [  3 , 4 . ]

## Histopathology

There is an infi  ltrate  of  infl  ammatory  cells  including  T  lymphocytes, dendritic cells, eosinophils and mast cells in the dermis [  1  ]. Within the epidermis there may be loss of the granular layer and thinning of the suprapapillary plate [  2  ]. Early lesions are vesicles that develop into pustules containing mononuclear cells and neutrophils as they become more superfi  cial [  3  ]. Early vesicles appear to arise in or near epidermal sweat ducts [  4  ], around which are increased numbers of Langerhans cells [  5  ]. In health, the cells of the sweat duct are thought to be immunocompetent, expressing HLA-DR, IL-1 α ,  IL-8  and  TNFα .  Lesional  palmoplantar  pustulosis  skin  overexpresses  IL-17A,  IL-8,  TNFα and  antimicrobial peptides,  some  of  which  derive  from  the  acrosyringium  [  4  ,  6  ]. Keratinocytes  from  the  interductal  epidermis  of  palmoplantar pustulosis skin has been shown to have an altered staining pattern for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: the authors suggested that an abnormal response to nicotine in patients with palmoplantar pustulosis resulted in infl  ammation [  5  ].

## Causative organisms

The pustules in palmoplantar pustulosis are sterile. Distant septic foci, particularly in the tonsils or oro-pharynx, have been held responsible by some Japanese researchers, who have reported an increased production of cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA) positive T cells in the tonsils of patients with palmoplantar pustulosis  [  1,2  ].  Resolution  of  palmoplantar  pustulosis  in  up  to 60% of cases following tonsillectomy has been described by these groups in retrospective case series [  1  ,  3  ].

## Genetics

The heritability of palmoplantar pustulosis is not known precisely. Molecular  genetic  studies  have  demonstrated  that  it  is  genetically distinct from plaque psoriasis. In particular, palmoplantar pustulosis is not associated with the major psoriasis susceptibility locus PSORS1 or HLA-C:06:02 [  1 . Germline mutations in ] IL36RN have been identified in three of 139 European palmoplantar pustulosis patients, who were found to be homozygous for p.Ser113Leu substitution; an additional four were heterozygous for this mutation [  2  ]. Genetic association with polymorphisms in an autophagy gene ( ATG16L1 and IL-19 ) family members reported from a cohort of palmoplantar pustulosis patients from Estonia have not yet been replicated [  3,4  ].

## Clinical features

## History

tching is variable; more often the patient complains of 'burning' I discomfort in the lesions.

## Presentation

The disease presents with one or more well-defi  ned plaques. On the  hands,  the  thenar  eminence  is  the  most  common  site.  Less commonly, the hypothenar eminence or the central palm or the distal palm are involved. On the feet, the instep, the medial or lateral  border  of  the  foot  at  the  level  of  the  instep,  or  the  sides  or back of the heel are involved. Less frequently, the distal sole or the whole sole is implicated. Digital lesions are uncommon although associated subungual pustulation is sometimes seen [  1  ]. A striking symmetry of the lesions on the hands or feet is common, but sometimes a solitary lesion persists for months before others appear.

The  affected  area  is  dusky  red  and  scaly,  and  fi  ssures  may develop. Removal of scale (e.g. by treatment) leaves a glazed dullred surface. Within this plaque, numerous pustules are present, usually  2-5  mm  in  diameter.  In  early  disease,  dermoscopy  can help  to  identify  vesicles,  or  vesicopustules  within  plaques,  the lesions arising at the top of dermatoglyphic ridges [  2  ]. Fresh pustules are yellow; older ones are yellow-brown or dark brown as the pustule dries. Normally, pustules in all stages of evolution are seen (Figure   35.40  a,b). Eventually, the desiccated pustule is exfoliated. Plaques of psoriasis may be present elsewhere on the body in a minority of patients, and may be mild and atypical [  3  ].

caused by rubber in footwear should not cause diagnostic diffi  culties: typically the insteps are spared. The chronic acropustulosis seen in black infants does not occur in adults, and affects the digits and dorsal aspects of the extremities as well as the palms and soles.

## Differential diagnosis

Tinea  and  eczema  are  the  most  common  differential  diagnoses. Tinea  is  usually  asymmetrical  or  unilateral  and  the  toe  clefts  may be involved. Microscopy and culture or Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will confi  rm the diagnosis. Secondary infection of eczema may be pustular but is more painful, and Gram stains and culture of pustule contents will establish the diagnosis. Allergic contact dermatitis

## Classifi  cation of severity

The impact of involvement of palmoplantar skin on physical functioning and quality of life is disproportionate to the relatively small area affected [  1,2  ]. There are no well-validated severity scores in widespread clinical use. In clinical trials, the palmoplantar PASI (ppPASI) or fresh pustule counts have sometimes been used [  3  ,    ]. 4

## Disease course and prognosis

The course is usually prolonged. Slow spread or extension may be refractory to all treatment. Sometimes spontaneous remission does occur but is more often temporary than permanent. In one cohort of 59 patients, only nine had a remission for more than a year [  1  ].

## nvestigations I

The diagnosis can usually be made clinically. Skin scrapings for mycological examination may be needed, and occasionally bacterial swabs or patch testing may be indicated.

## Management

Effective therapy is elusive and treatment is often as disappointing for the physician as for the patient. There is a pressing need for  more  effective  treatment  and  for  higher  quality  evidence  of effi  cacy and safety. In view of the fi  nding that palmoplantar pustulosis is immunogenetically distinct from plaque psoriasis, it is perhaps unsurprising that using conventional psoriasis therapies to treat palmoplantar pustulosis is not ideal.

## Topical

It is usual to start with topical therapy but topical treatments alone are  often  ineffective  for  palmoplantar  pustulosis.  Super-potent topical corticosteroids may be benefi  cial in the short term. Hydrocolloid gel occlusion can enhance effi  cacy of moderate potency steroid creams [  1,2  ]. Atrophy, particularly of the skin around the medial longitudinal arch, is a signifi  cant risk. There are no published controlled trials to support the effi  cacy of calcipotriol, coal tar, dithranol or tazarotene.

## Phototherapy

Studies of topical PUVA with either soak, paint or gel psoralen, have failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo. Oral PUVA is often effective in improving palmoplantar pustulosis and will sometimes clear the disease temporarily; the response is enhanced by combination with an oral retinoid (re-PUVA), which can produce remission in up to 60% of people [  3  ]. There is some evidence for improvement with Grenz ray therapy [  4  ] or excimer laser [ 5 . ]

## Systemic therapy

Systemic therapies offer the best opportunity for remission. Oral retinoids  have  established  effi  cacy  for  induction  of  remission and also as maintenance therapy. Most clinical trials were carried out in the 1980s, were small and evaluated etretinate, before the development of acitretin. They demonstrated a good to excellent short-term response in about 40% of patients [  3  ]. One trial demonstrated similar effi  cacy with acitretin at a dose of 30 mg daily [  6  . Response rates with ciclosporin are higher. Most patients will ] respond in the short term to ciclosporin 2.5 mg/kg/day [  7  ] and some patients can be maintained on doses as low as 1 mg/kg/ day [  8  ]. The dose should be tapered rather than stopped abruptly in view of rare instances of provoking generalized pustular psoriasis [  9  ]. Uncontrolled small case series have demonstrated effi  cacy  in  some  patients  treated  with  methotrexate,  lefl  unomide, alitretinoin, FAEs and dapsone [  10-13  ]. There may be a modest improvement with oral tetracycline or colchicine in a minority of patients [  10  ,  14  ].

## Biological therapy

The  effectiveness  of  TNFi  has  not  been  adequately  assessed  in the treatment of palmoplantar pustulosis. Only etanercept 50 mg twice weekly has been studied in a small randomized controlled trial  in  15  patients,  which  demonstrated  no  statistically  signifi  cant improvement (or deterioration) compared with placebo [  15  ]. There are occasional reports of response to TNFi, but palmoplantar pustulosis is more frequently induced or exacerbated by this class of biological [  16  ]. Small case series with the IL-12/IL-23 p40 monoclonal antibody ustekinumab suggest that it may prove to be  a  useful  treatment  for  some  patients  [  17,18  ]  but  this  has  not been confi  rmed  in  a  small  placebo-controlled  trial  [  19  ].  Prior  to their withdrawal from the market, there were case reports of effi  cacy of efalizumab and alefacept [  20-22  ]. Anakinra (IL-1RA) has recently been reported to be partially effective in two individuals with severe palmoplantar pustulosis resistant to TNFi and to ustekinumab [  23  ].

## ntroduction and general description I

The  relationship  between  acrodermatitis  continua  of  Hallopeau and psoriasis in general and with generalized pustular psoriasis

in particular has been debated since the entity was fi  rst recognized by Hallopeau in 1890 [  1  ]. Patients with acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau do not usually have additional plaque psoriasis. The distribution of lesions in acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau is distinctive; as is the local destruction of soft tissue, nail apparatus and sometimes the terminal digit.

## Epidemiology [  1 ]

## ncidence and prevalence I

This is a rare entity, described in case reports and small case series only. Its incidence and prevalence are unknown.

## Age at onset

This may be seen in children. It is rare in young adults and, unlike palmoplantar pustulosis, not infrequently begins in old age.

## Gender

t is more common in women. I

## Associated diseases

Clinical features may overlap with palmoplantar pustulosis, and may evolve into generalized pustular psoriasis [  1  ].

## Pathophysiology

## Histopathology [  1 ]

The features are similar to those of generalized pustular psoriasis. In the epidermis, there are numerous subcorneal neutrophilic pustules and spongiform pustules with hypergranulosis and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis. There is a lymphocytic infi  ltrate in the dermis, which in chronic disease may become atrophic.

## Genetics

IL36RN has been sequenced in nine Europeans with acrodermatitis  continua  of  Hallopeau.  Two  unrelated  patients  were  found  to have mutations (homozygous p.Ser113Leu in one and compound heterozygote p.Arg35Trp/p.Ser113Leu in the other) [  1  ]. A Lebanese man with acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau has been reported in whom  a  mutation  in IL36RN was  detected  (homozygous p.Ser113Leu).  His  sister  who  had  generalized  pustular  psoriasis (von Zumbusch) without acral involvement had the same IL36RN mutation, supporting the view that acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau is a localized variant of generalized pustular psoriasis [  2  ].

Recently, germline mutations in AP1S3 were identifi  ed in four of seven unrelated individuals with acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau and subsequently a small number of patients with generalized pustular psoriasis and palmoplantar pustulosis [ 3 . ] AP1S3 encodes the σ 1C subunit of the adaptor protein complex 1, which is involved in vesicular transport between the transgolgi network and endosomes. The functional signifi  cance of these mutations is yet to be established but may involve impaired TLR3 signalling.

## Environmental factors

The  onset  is  often  attributed by the patient to minor trauma, or infection at the tip of the digit. It may be precipitated or aggravated by oral corticosteroids.

## Clinical features

## History and presentation

The fi  rst lesion starts on a fi  nger or thumb more often than on a toe. The skin over the distal phalanx becomes red and scaly, and pustules develop. The nail folds and nail bed may be involved, leading  to  nail  dystrophy.  The  proximal  edge  of  the  lesion  is bordered  by  a  fringe  of  undermined  epidermis,  irregular,  often sodden  and  sometimes  preceded  by  a  line  of  vesiculopustules. Removal of scale or desiccation of pustules may leave a brighter red, glazed, very sore and painful digit. Slow proximal extension is the rule but this may take several years. Eventually, other digits may be involved. The nail plate may be completely destroyed (Figure   35.42  a,b). Bone changes can occur with osteolysis of the tuft of

the distal phalanx. The free end of the digit may become wasted and tapered, mimicking scleroderma. In such digits, the circulation may be secondarily affected so that discomfort is greatest in cold weather. Acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau may evolve into generalized pustular psoriasis, especially in the elderly [  1  ].

## Differential diagnosis

In  the  earliest  stage,  staphylococcal  infection,  pulp  infection, herpetic  whitlow,  tinea  or  contact  dermatitis  may  be  suspected. Candidiasis is only likely to be a problem in the immunocompromised. Parakeratosis pustulosa should be considered in children.

## Disease course and prognosis

The usual course is prolonged. Slow spread or extension may be refractory to all treatment. Sometimes spontaneous remission does occur but is more often temporary than permanent.

## nvestigations I

The diagnosis can usually be made clinically. Swabs for bacterial culture should be taken.

## Management

Acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau is often refractory and the evidence  base  for  treatment  is  poor,  consisting  mainly  of  case reports.  Potent  topical  corticosteroids  may  improve  symptoms [  1    and  there  are  also  reports  of  effi  cacy  with  topical  tacrolimus ] [  2   and calcipotriol [  3,4  ]. Acitretin or ciclosporin may be effective ] in some cases [  5  ]. In contrast with palmoplantar pustulosis, TNFi appear to have a role in treatment although it may need to given at higher than licensed doses or in combination with systemic treatment [  6  ]. There is a report of the rapid clearance of pustules within 24 h of starting the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra in a patient who was resistant to adalimumab and ustekinumab [  7  ].

## SORIATIC ARTHRITIS P

## Defi  nition and nomenclature

Psoriatic arthritis is a seronegative infl  ammatory arthritis, which occurs in up to 40% of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.  It  can  be  destructive  to  joints  and  adds  considerably  to  the

able 35.7 T Classifi  cation of Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) criteria for psoriatic arthritis. To be characterized as having psoriatic arthritis, a patient with infl  ammatory articular disease (joint, spine or entheseal) must have three or more points from fi  ve categories. Each category scores a maximum of 1 point, except category 1, which scores 2 points for current psoriasis.

mpairment of quality of life and symptoms such as fatigue sufi fered by patients with psoriasis [  1  ]. The quality of life impairment and disease burden associated with psoriatic arthritis is similar to that seen in rheumatoid arthritis [  2-4  ]. There is a genetic susceptibility  with  an  increased  risk  amongst  family  members  of  both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [  5  ].

n  rheumatology  practice,  psoriatic  arthritis  can  be  differentiI ated from other forms of arthritis according to CASPAR (Classifi  cation Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis) criteria, with 99% sensitivity and 91% specifi  city (Table   35.7  ) [ 6 ]. A diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis  is  made in the presence of an infl  ammatory articular disease (joint, enthesis or spine) if some or all of the following criteria are met: current psoriasis; personal history of psoriasis; family history of psoriasis in a fi  rst- or second-degree relative; nail psoriasis; dactylitis (infl  ammation of an entire fi  nger or toe) (Figure   35.43  ); and plain radiographic evidence of juxta-articular new bone formation on the hands or feet.

Psoriatic arthritis is clinically heterogeneous. It has been traditionally classifi  ed according to the criteria of Moll and Wright, although there is considerable overlap between the subtypes [    ]. 7 It can occur as peripheral mono- or asymmetrical oligo-arthritis,

predominantly affecting the distal interphalangeal joints (Figure 35.44  ) (a distinguishing feature from rheumatoid arthritis), symmetrical rheumatoid-like pattern, arthritis mutilans (a rare severe deforming arthritis of the hands and feet) (Figure   35.45  ),  axial disease with spondylitis and/or sacro-iliac disease. Although the original classifi  cation of Moll and Wright remains valid, several alternative  classifi  cations have been proposed [ 8 . Asymmetric ] oligo-arthritis is the commonest variety followed by symmetric polyarthritis.  A  pattern  of  predominant  distal  interphalangeal involvement  is  often  found.  Spondylitis  is  reported  in  50%  of patients and the rare arthritis mutilans is the last classifi  cation. This  classifi  cation  is  useful,  but  overlap  between  the  subtypes occurs.

## ynonyms and inclusions S

- •    Psoriatic arthropathy

## pidemiology E

## ncidence and prevalence I

There  is  a  wide  variation  in  the  reported  annual  incidence (&lt;0.01-0.25%) and prevalence (0.5-23.1/100 000) of psoriatic arthritis  [  1,2  ].  This  variation  probably  refl  ects  ethnic  variation and methodological differences in the published studies. Arthritis mutilans occurs in between 3 and 5 per million people [  3  ]. It is associated with enthesitis, dactylitis and more severe skin disease and is equally divided between the sexes.

## Age at onset

The majority of patients develop psoriatic arthritis before the age of 40 years. Childhood onset is rare. The incidence appears to be equal between the sexes although men may have more axial disease  and  less  peripheral  arthritis.  The  majority  of  patients  have psoriasis  prior  to  the  onset  of  arthritis.  In  70%  of  patients,  the skin features of psoriasis develop prior to joint disease, in 20% of patients, the joint disease presents fi  rst and in 10% the skin and joints are affected concurrently [  1  ].

## Associated diseases

There  is  an  association  between  more  severe  cutaneous  psoriasis and the development of psoriatic arthritis. The prevalence of psoriatic arthritis is also increased in patients with nail and scalp psoriasis [    ]. 2

Ocular  diseases  occur  in  up  to  30%  of  patients  with  psoriatic arthritis. The majority of these patients develop conjunctivitis with uveitis. Iridocyclitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca and cataracts have also been reported [  3  ]. Although less well studied than in psoriasis alone, there are associations between psoriatic arthritis and obesity/metabolic syndrome and alcohol misuse [  4,5  ]. Premature cardiovascular disease is also associated with psoriatic arthritis [  6  ].

## Genetics and pathophysiology

Psoriatic  arthritis  has  a  strong  heritable  component.  Although there are no well-powered twin registry studies, heritability calculated  from  recurrence  risk  in  fi  rst-degree  relatives  estimates a  greater  genetic  component  to  psoriatic  arthritis  than  cutaneous psoriasis [  1  ]. In common with cutaneous psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis  is  associated  with  MHC  alleles,  but  the  nature  of  the association appears to be different [  2  ]. Although associated with HLA-C:06:02 the magnitude of the association is small compared , with cutaneous psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis is also associated with several  HLA-B alleles, notably HLA-B13 , HLA-B27 , HLA-B38/39 , HLA-B57 and HLA-DRB1*04 [  3  . There is evidence that HLA types ] infl  uence  the  presentation  of  psoriatic  arthritis.  In  patients  with psoriatic arthritis, HLA-C:06:02 without B27 or B39 is associated with early onset of psoriasis with the subsequent development of psoriatic arthritis 10 years after the skin disease. In contrast, the presence of HLA-B27 and/or B39 is associated with the simultaneous development of early joint and skin disease. The skin disease also appears to be less severe than in those patients who are HLA-C:06:02 positive [  ]. 4

Genome-wide association scans in psoriatic arthritis have replicated  many  psoriasis  susceptibility  loci  but  without  identifying any new loci specifi  c to joint disease. There may be a slightly higher  effect  size  for TRAF3IP2 in  psoriatic  arthritis  compared with psoriasis [  5  ,    ]. 6

## Causes

Psoriatic  arthritis  may  be  triggered  by  trauma  to  a  joint  or  tendon - the so-called deep Koebner effect. Cigarette smoking and excess alcohol intake are also associated with the disease [  1  ]. HIV infection is associated with the initiation or worsening of psoriatic arthritis whereas rheumatoid arthritis improves in HIV infection [  2  ]. In contrast to cutaneous psoriasis, streptococcal infection, medications such as lithium or psychological stress do not appear to  be  triggers  of  psoriatic  arthritis.  Similar  to  psoriasis,  there  is an increased incidence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome in patients with psoriatic arthritis [    ]. 3

## athophysiology P

The pathophysiology of psoriatic arthritis is similar to psoriasis with immune activation in the synovium and enthesis of affected joints. There is activation of both innate and adaptive immune cells with overproduction of multiple cytokines including TNFα , IL-17 and IL-23. Angiogenesis is increased in the synovium and appears to  be  more  prominent  than  in  rheumatoid  arthritis.  In  response to  the  infl  ammation,  joint  fi  brosis  occurs.  There  may  be  erosion of bone with abnormal bone formation occurring simultaneously, resulting in joint deformities and loss of function [ 1 ,2  ].

There are important differences, however, in the infl  ammatory process  in  the  joint  compared  to  the  skin.  IL-17,  Th17  cells  and IL-23 production appear to be less prominent in psoriatic synovitis compared to the skin [ 1 . These differences in pathophysiol-] ogy may infl  uence the observed differential therapeutic responses between the skin and joints to systemic and biological treatments.

## Clinical features

The diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis is  important and an enquiry regarding joint symptoms should be made at every consultation in patients with psoriasis. Symptoms of infl  ammatory joint disease (early morning stiffness and joint swelling) should be ascertained. Early morning back stiffness may be the only clinical feature of sacro-iliitis or cervical spondylitis. Heel pain (a manifestation of enthesitis of the Achilles tendon) or plantar fasciitis may also be a presenting feature.

Clinical examination may reveal evidence of dactylitis (sausage fingers) or swollen or tender joints. This may affect one joint in an asymmetric pattern or several joints simultaneously. The features may be subtle and diagnosis is often delayed. The nail changes of psoriasis will be present in up to 80% of patients.

Most dermatologists are not profi  cient at joint examination but a reasonable approach is to examine the joints of the hands and feet  for  evidence  of  joint  swelling  or  tenderness  and  dactylitis. The diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis may be challenging even for an experienced rheumatologist. Recent studies have suggested that up  to  30%  of  patients  attending  specialist  psoriasis  clinics  may have undiagnosed psoriatic arthritis [  1,2  ]. Several screening questionnaires have been developed to assist with the early diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. These include the Psoriasis Arthritis Screening Evaluation (PASE), the Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool

(PEST) and the Toronto Arthritis Screening Questionnaire (ToPAS) tools  [  1,2  ].  Studies  assessing  these  screening  tools  suggest  that they may be benefi  cial in helping dermatologists to refer patients for appropriate rheumatological assessment.

## Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnoses include early rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, gout, osteoarthritis and fi  bromyalgia.

## Classifi  cation of severity

Disease severity may be assessed by a variety of measures. These include  the  American  College  of  Rheumatology  (ACR)  tender and swollen joint count. The ACR-20 refers to a 20% improvement in swollen and tender joint count and a 20% improvement in patient and physician global assessment, pain, disability and acute phase reactant measurement. ACR-50 and ACR-70 refer to a 50% and 70% improvement, respectively, in these criteria [  1  ]. The Disease Activity Score (DAS) is calculated using swollen and painful joint scores together with the measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) is defi  ned as a specifi  ed improvement in at least two of the following four measures, without worsening of the others: patient  global  assessment,  physician  global  assessment,  tender joint count and swollen joint count [  2  ]. Scores assessing quality of life and dactylitis scores have also been developed [  2  ]. Composite  indices  that  include  the  severity  of  cutaneous  psoriasis have also been proposed [  3  , 4 . Most measures of disease severity ] for psoriatic arthritis have been adapted from rheumatoid arthritis and controversy exists as to whether they are truly a refl  ection of severity in psoriatic arthritis. Nonetheless the ACR measures are those required from licensing agencies for new drug approval for psoriatic arthritis.

## nvestigations I

nvestigations include tests for infl  ammation (including C-reacI tive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), uric acid, rheumatoid factor and anticyclic citrillated peptide (CCP) antibodies. Plain  X-rays  of  the  hands  and  feet  may  be  useful  in  detecting erosive disease but plain X-rays have a low diagnostic sensitivity in  early  disease.  Other  imaging  modalities  such  as  ultrasound or  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  are  useful  in  assessing enthesitis, and MRI is the modality of choice for assessing axial disease.

## reatment T

Psoriatic arthritis should be managed by a rheumatologist. Early treatment is important as early interventions may prevent irreversible  joint  damage.  Several  guidelines  have  been  published which provide treatment algorithms for physicians to assist them in  the  management of psoriatic arthritis [  1-3  ].  The  therapeutic options for psoriatic arthritis  are  not  as  broad  as  those  for  the skin disease, and are infl  uenced by the pattern of the articular disease (Figure   35.46  ).

The main treatments have been NSAIDs, methotrexate, oral corticosteroids, sulphasalazine, lefl  unomide and TNFi. Ustekinumab and apremilast have been licensed recently for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. A single agent that combines effi  cacy on both the skin disease and the arthritis is preferred. In practice, in those patients with moderate to severe skin disease this currently means either methotrexate or TNFi.

psoriasis in the skin. Sulphasalazine has been reported as effective in small open trials in psoriatic arthritis but has been disappointing in placebo-controlled trials. Nonetheless it continues to be  used  in  clinical  practice.  The  effi  cacy  of  ciclosporin  in  psoriatic arthritis has not been adequately addressed, and its use is not recommended in some guidelines [  4  ]. Axial disease appears to be resistant to treatment with conventional systemic therapy.

Non-steroidal  anti-infl  ammatory  drugs  are  the  mainstay  of treatment in patients with mild disease. In view of their potential toxicities, the lowest dose should be used for short-term control of  symptoms  only  [  4  ].  Oral  corticosteroids  are  used  commonly for the control of acute fl  ares of psoriatic arthritis. This may cause instability of cutaneous psoriasis and a slow reduction of the dose is  recommended  in  order  to  try  and  avoid  deterioration  of  the skin and/or generalized pustular psoriasis. Joint injections with corticosteroids  can  provide  symptomatic relief but there is little evidence that they prevent bone remodelling and fi  brosis. Physiotherapy may also be benefi  cial.

## ystemic therapy S

The  systemic  treatments  used  for  peripheral  psoriatic  arthritis, enthesitis and dactylitis have limited evidence for their use [  1-3  ]. Methotrexate has been studied in several trials in psoriatic arthritis.  In  one  randomized  controlled  trial  of  methotrexate  15  mg weekly  compared  to  placebo  in  patients  with  active  psoriatic arthritis,  there  was no benefi  t  of  methotrexate compared to placebo when the ACR-20 criteria and the DAS-28 score were used [  5  .  The trial did report improvements in patient symptoms. The ] results of this trial contrast with several smaller studies that have shown positive effects [  6,7  ]. The data have called into question the usefulness of methotrexate monotherapy in managing the acute synovitis of psoriatic arthritis.

Lefl  unomide  has  demonstrated  effi  cacy  in  psoriatic  arthritis compared to placebo [  8  ] and also in the real-life setting of clinical practice [  9  ]. It does not often, however, have a benefi  cial effect on

Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, has shown effi  cacy in psoriasis and other infl  ammatory diseases and has been recently licensed in the US and Europe. In a study of 204 patients with psoriatic arthritis, apremilast 20 mg taken orally twice daily or 40 mg daily had superior ACR-20 responses at week 12 compared to placebo. The ACR-20 responses were 43.5%, 35.8% and 11.8% in the 20 mg twice daily, the 40 mg daily and placebo, respectively. No safety signals were seen in this small study [  10  ]. A phase 3 trial of 504 patients with psoriatic arthritis compared the effects of apremilast 20 mg twice daily, apremilast 30 mg twice daily and placebo over 16 weeks. The ACR-20 responses were 31%, 40% and 19%, respectively, with signifi  cant differences between both doses and placebo [  11  ].

T ofacitinib, a JAK-2 inhibitor, is an oral small molecule therapy that is currently undergoing clinical trials in psoriatic arthritis and is licensed in the US for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [  12  ].

## Biological treatment

The  use  of  TNFi  has  revolutionized  the  treatment  of  psoriatic arthritis. These are recommended for patients with active psoriatic  arthritis  affecting  more  than  three  joints  that  have  failed  to respond to at least two systemic treatments, or for axial disease that has failed to respond to NSAIDS and/or local corticosteroids [  13  ].

nfl  iximab, at a dose of 5 mg/kg, has been shown to improve psoI riatic arthritis compared to placebo. Of patients treated with infl  iximab, 65% reached the ACR-20 primary end point compared to 10% with placebo. The benefi  ts were maintained to 50 weeks [  14  ]. This

study also provided evidence that infl  iximab improved the quality of life of treated patients and prevented radiological progression of the disease [  15,16  ]. Concomitant methotrexate has been shown to prolong retention on treatment [  17  ].

Etanercept, at a dose of 25 mg subcutaneously twice weekly, has been shown to improve psoriatic arthritis compared to placebo. In a study of 60 patients over 12 weeks, 87% of patients treated with etanercept met PsARC compared to 23% of placebo-treated patients. ARC-20 was achieved by 73% of patients compared to 13%  of  placebo  patients  [  18  ].  In  a  study  comparing  etanercept 50 mg twice weekly to 50 mg once weekly in patients with severe psoriasis  and  psoriatic  arthritis,  the  higher  dose  of  etanercept resulted in better PASI outcomes but the PsARC response at 12 weeks was similar in both groups (77% compared to 76%) [  19  ]. While the combination of methotrexate and etanercept has demonstrated increased effi  cacy in rheumatoid arthritis, there are no controlled trials assessing this combination in psoriatic arthritis.

Adalimumab,  at  a  dose  of  40  mg  subcutaneously  every  2 weeks, has demonstrated effi  cacy in psoriatic arthritis compared to placebo. At week 12, 58% of patients treated with adalimumab achieved the primary end point of ACR-20 compared to 14% of placebo patients. Adalimumab improved the joint manifestations, quality of life and skin disease. It also improved radiological progression of the disease [  20  ]. There are no controlled studies on the use  of  methotrexate  with  adalimumab  in  psoriatic  arthritis  but registry studies suggest that no additional effi  cacy is achieved by the addition of methotrexate [  21  ].

Two  additional TNFi (golimumab and certolizumab) are licensed for psoriatic arthritis but have not been developed for the treatment of cutaneous psoriasis. In a placebo-controlled trial of golimumab in psoriatic arthritis, 48% of patients receiving golimumab 50 mg every 4 weeks and 46% of patients receiving 100 mg every 4 weeks achieved the ACR-20 criteria compared with 9% of placebo patients [  22  ]. Certolizumab, a pegylated humanized TNFi fragment,  has  shown  effi  cacy  in  psoriatic  arthritis  and  also  in Crohn disease. In a phase 3 study, 368 patients were randomized to  receive  certolizumab  200  mg  every  2  weeks,  certolizumab 400 mg every 4 weeks or placebo for 24 weeks. At week 12, 58% of  the  certolizumab  200  mg  every  2  weeks  reached  the ACR-20 primary end point compared to 51% of those in the certolizumab 400 mg every 4 weeks group and 24.3% in the placebo group. Certolizumab improved all aspects of the disease including physical function and radiographic progression. The clinical improvements were signifi  cant after 1 week of treatment [  23  ].

Ustekinumab has also been shown to be effective for psoriatic arthritis in a randomized controlled trial; 605 patients were randomized to ustekinumab 45 mg, ustekinumab 90 mg or placebo at week 0, 4, 16 and every 12 weeks thereafter. ACR-20 at week 24 was achieved in 42.4% of the 45 mg group, 49.5% of the 90 mg group and 22.8% of placebo-treated patients.  The  response  was maintained at 52 weeks. Improvements were also seen in dactylitis and enthesitis and in radiological progression of the disease [  24,25  ].

Inhibitors of IL-17 and its receptor are undergoing clinical trials but are not yet licensed for psoriatic arthritis. Brodalumab, a monoclonal antibody to the IL-17 receptor A, was assessed in a phase 2  randomized  placebo-controlled  trial.  Patients  received  either brodalumab 140 mg, 280 mg or placebo over 12 weeks. The ACR-20 responses at week 12 were 37%, 39% and 18%, respectively. These responses were maintained to week 52 [  26  ]. Secukinumab a monoclonal antibody to IL-17A was assessed in 42 patients with psoriatic arthritis. Patients were given two intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg 3 weeks apart or placebo. The primary end point was the ACR-20 at 6 weeks. At week 6, there was no difference in ACR-20 response between secukinumab (39%) and placebo (23%). At week 12, secukinumab was more effective (ACR-20 of 39% compared to 15% for placebo) but this was not statistically signifi  cant. There were signifi  cant improvements in quality of life and acute phase reactants. There are ongoing trials of secukinumab in psoriatic arthritis [  27  ].
