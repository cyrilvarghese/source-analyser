 

## **Master Clinical Case: Bacterial Vaginosis**

---

### **Part 1: Case Description**

**(As previously approved)**

**Patient Profile:**

* Age: 28 years  
* Gender: Female  
* Marital Status: Married (Monogamous relationship for 3 years)  
* Occupation: Software Developer (Works from home)  
* Menstrual history: Regular 28-30 day cycles, moderate flow  
* Contraception: Oral contraceptive pills for 2 years

**Chief Complaint:** "I've had this really embarrassing vaginal discharge and a persistent unpleasant odor for about two weeks now. It's making me feel quite self-conscious."

**History of Present Illness:** Ms. Anya Sharma, a 28-year-old, describes a gradual onset of a persistent, thin, grayish-white vaginal discharge over the past two weeks. The most distressing symptom for her is a strong, fishy odor, which she notes becomes more pronounced after intercourse and sometimes after her workouts. She feels very embarrassed by the odor and it's affecting her confidence. Initially, thinking it was a "yeast infection," she tried an over-the-counter antifungal cream for 7 days, which provided no relief and possibly worsened the odor. She denies any vulvar itching, burning, dysuria, or dyspareunia. There are no associated systemic symptoms like fever or abdominal pain. This is the first time she has experienced such symptoms. She appears hesitant when discussing the symptoms, particularly the odor.

**Key Risk Factors:**

* Patient reports occasional vaginal douching with commercial products "to feel clean," especially after her periods.  
* Recent increase in stress levels due to work deadlines.

**Relevant Review of Systems Snippet:**

* Genitourinary: As per HPI. Denies urinary frequency or urgency. Denies external genital lesions or sores.  
* Systemic: Denies fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats.

### **Part 2: Primary Symptoms**

1. Thin, homogenous, grayish-white vaginal discharge.  
2. Strong, unpleasant "fishy" odor, often worse after sexual intercourse or menses.  
3. Increased volume of vaginal discharge.  
4. Absence of significant vulvar itching or burning (key negative symptom distinguishing from candidiasis).  
5. Absence of dysuria or significant lower abdominal pain.  
6. ⚡️ Mandatory image: Speculum view showing typical thin, grayish-white discharge coating vaginal walls.

---

### **Part 3: Background Factors**

**Relevant Medical & Social History:**

* History of occasional vaginal douching (reported by patient, contributing factor).  
* Use of oral contraceptive pills (generally not a direct cause but part of her profile).  
* Sexually active in a monogamous relationship.  
* High stress levels recently (can sometimes influence vaginal flora).

**Potentially Distracting/Non-Contributory Information:**

* No recent antibiotic use (rules out antibiotic-induced dysbiosis as a primary cause for *this episode*).  
* No known history of diabetes or immunosuppression.  
* Patient mentions she recently switched her brand of laundry detergent (unlikely related).  
* Patient is lactose intolerant (unrelated to vaginal symptoms). *(The 'Stigma or Shame' is subtly indicated by her embarrassment and initial hesitation, and her attempt at self-treatment to avoid consultation.)*

---

### **Part 6: Information Gathering & Clue Unlocking**

**Key History Questions to Ask:**

1. "Can you describe the discharge in more detail – its color, consistency, and how much there is?"  
2. "You mentioned an odor. Can you describe it? Does anything make it stronger or less noticeable?" (Confirms fishy odor, worse post-coitus)  
3. "Have you experienced any itching, burning, or soreness in the vaginal area?" (Establishes absence, key for DDx)  
4. "Do you use any products inside your vagina, like douches, scented soaps, or spermicides?" (Reveals douching – **Missable Clue** if patient is ashamed or doesn't think it's relevant due to it being a "hygiene" practice).  
5. "Has there been any change in your sexual partners recently, or any concerns about your partner's health?" (Assesses STI risk)  
6. "Have you ever had symptoms like this before?" (Establishes this is a first episode for her)  
7. "Apart from the OTC antifungal, have you taken any other medications recently, like antibiotics?"  
8. "How has this been affecting you emotionally or in your daily life?" (Addresses emotional impact and stigma)

**Expected Vital Signs:**

* Temperature: Afebrile (e.g., 37.0°C / 98.6°F)  
* Heart Rate: 70-80 bpm  
* Blood Pressure: e.g., 110/70 mmHg  
* Respiratory Rate: 14-16 breaths/min

**Key Expected Physical Exam Findings & Their Significance:**

* External Genitalia: Normal appearance, no erythema, edema, or lesions. – *Significance: Lack of inflammation argues against candidiasis or herpes.*  
* Speculum Examination:  
  * Vaginal walls: Coated with a thin, homogenous, grayish-white discharge. Discharge is often adherent to the walls. – *Significance: Characteristic appearance of BV discharge.*  
  * Cervix: Appears normal, no erythema, friability, or mucopurulent discharge. – *Significance: Makes cervicitis less likely.*  
* Vaginal pH: \>4.5 (e.g., 5.0-5.5). – *Significance: Elevated pH is a key criterion for BV, helps differentiate from candidiasis (normal pH).*  
* Whiff Test: Positive (a distinct fishy odor upon addition of 10% KOH to vaginal discharge sample). – *Significance: Caused by volatilization of amines produced by anaerobic bacteria, highly suggestive of BV.*  
* Bimanual Examination: No uterine, adnexal, or cervical motion tenderness. – *Significance: Rules out Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).*

---

### **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis & Initial Reasoning**

**Most Likely Primary Diagnosis:** **Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)**

**Reasoning Supporting This Diagnosis:**

* Presence of thin, homogenous, grayish-white vaginal discharge.  
* Patient report of a strong, fishy odor, especially post-coital.  
* History of douching (a known risk factor).  
* Absence of vulvar itching or significant inflammation (argues against Candidiasis or Trichomoniasis as the sole cause).  
* Initial failure of OTC antifungal treatment (supports the idea that it's not simple candidiasis – the 'Mystery Hook' resolution).

**Initial Differentiation from Key Alternatives:**

* Favored over Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC) due to the nature of discharge (thin/gray vs. thick/curdy), prominent fishy odor (absent in VVC), and lack of significant pruritus. Anticipated elevated pH also supports BV over VVC.  
* Favored over Trichomoniasis due to lack of vulvar irritation/pruritus, and discharge typically not being frothy/greenish-yellow. However, odor can be present in both.

**Suggested Concept Nodes for Diagnosis:**

1. **Amsel's Criteria:** **Specific Relevance:** The constellation of symptoms (discharge type, odor) and expected initial office findings (pH, Whiff test) directly align with components of Amsel's criteria, which will be used for definitive clinical diagnosis.  
2. **Vaginal Microbiome Disruption:** **Specific Relevance:** The patient's history of douching is a key risk factor that directly leads to the disruption of the normal Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal flora, allowing overgrowth of BV-associated anaerobes.  
3. **Differential Diagnosis of Vaginal Discharge:** **Specific Relevance:** The patient's symptoms require careful differentiation primarily from candidiasis and trichomoniasis, based on specific characteristics of discharge, odor, pH, and associated symptoms like itching.

---

### **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses & Differentiation**

**A) Plausible Differential Diagnoses (Should Be Considered):**

1. Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC)  
2. *Trichomonas vaginalis* Infection (Trichomoniasis)  
3. Aerobic Vaginitis (less common, but can present with discharge and elevated pH)

**B) Less Likely/Incorrect Differentials (Tempting but Ruled Out):**

1. Chlamydial or Gonococcal Cervicitis (Discharge is typically mucopurulent from cervix; no other PID signs)  
2. Physiological Leukorrhea (Odor and character of discharge are abnormal)

**C) Rationale for Excluding Incorrect Differentials:**

* Chlamydial/Gonococcal Cervicitis: The discharge described is vaginal, not primarily cervical. Speculum exam expected to show no cervical friability or mucopurulent endocervical discharge. No abdominal pain or CMT.  
* Physiological Leukorrhea: The strong fishy odor and grayish color are inconsistent with normal physiological discharge.

**D) Key Differentiating Features for Plausible Differentials (vs. Primary Diagnosis \- Bacterial Vaginosis):**

| Differential Diagnosis | Differentiating History Clue(s) | Differentiating Exam Finding(s) | Differentiating Test Result(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC) | Prominent itching/soreness; odor usually absent or yeasty. | Thick, white, "cottage cheese-like" discharge; vulvovaginal erythema/edema. | Vaginal pH typically normal (≤4.5); KOH mount: pseudohyphae/yeast. |
| *Trichomonas vaginalis* (Trichomoniasis) | Often itching/soreness, dysuria; discharge can be frothy, yellow-green. | Vulvovaginal erythema; "strawberry cervix" (punctate hemorrhages) in some cases; frothy discharge. | Saline wet mount: motile trichomonads; pH often \>4.5. |
| Aerobic Vaginitis | Vaginal soreness/burning, dyspareunia; discharge often purulent, yellowish. | Significant vulvovaginal inflammation; erosions. | Microscopy: abundant WBCs, paucity of lactobacilli, presence of cocci. pH often \>4.5. |

---

### **Part 9: Test Interpretation & Diagnostic Confirmation**

**A) Expected Positive/Confirmatory Test Results (for Bacterial Vaginosis):**

* **Vaginal pH test:** \>4.5 (e.g., 5.5). – *Significance: Indicates an alkaline vaginal environment, characteristic of BV.*  
* **Whiff test (10% KOH):** Positive (release of a fishy/amine odor). – *Significance: Confirms presence of volatile amines produced by anaerobic bacteria.*  
* **Saline wet mount microscopy:** Presence of clue cells (≥20% of epithelial cells); paucity of lactobacilli; possibly increased coccobacillary forms; few or no WBCs. ⚡️ **Mandatory image** of clue cells. – *Significance: Clue cells are the most reliable microscopic sign for BV.*

**B) Expected Results for Other Ordered/Considered Tests (Including Those Ruling Out Differentials):**

* **KOH wet mount microscopy:** Negative for pseudohyphae or yeast forms. – *Significance: Helps rule out Vulvovaginal Candidiasis.*  
* **Saline wet mount microscopy:** Absence of motile trichomonads. – *Significance: Helps rule out Trichomoniasis.*  
* *(If Gram stain/Nugent scoring performed):* Nugent score of 7-10. – *Significance: Confirmatory for BV based on bacterial morphotypes.*

**Suggested Concept Nodes for Test Interpretation:**

1. **Amsel's Criteria (Confirmation):** **Specific Relevance:** The combination of elevated pH, positive Whiff test, and clue cells on microscopy (along with characteristic discharge) fulfills at least 3 of the 4 Amsel's criteria, confirming the diagnosis of BV in this case.  
2. **Microscopic Identification (Clue Cells):** **Specific Relevance:** Visualizing clue cells (vaginal epithelial cells studded with bacteria, obscuring cell borders) on the saline wet mount is a key diagnostic hallmark distinguishing BV from other causes of vaginitis.

---

### **Part 10: Final Diagnosis & Case Summary Feedback Points**

**Final Confirmed Diagnosis:** **Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)**

**Key Evidence Summary Supporting Final Diagnosis:**

* Characteristic thin, homogenous, grayish-white discharge.  
* Patient report and objective finding (Whiff test) of fishy odor.  
* Elevated vaginal pH (\>4.5).  
* Presence of clue cells on saline wet mount microscopy.  
* Fulfillment of Amsel's criteria (at least 3 of 4: discharge, odor/Whiff test, pH, clue cells).

**Resolution of Differential Diagnoses:**

* Vulvovaginal Candidiasis: Ruled out by the absence of significant pruritus, nature of discharge (not curdy), elevated pH, and negative KOH mount for yeast.  
* Trichomoniasis: Ruled out by the absence of significant pruritus/inflammation, typical discharge characteristics (not frothy/greenish), and absence of motile trichomonads on wet mount.

**Reflection on Case Challenges (if any):**

* The patient's initial self-treatment with an antifungal (mystery hook) delayed correct diagnosis and management. This highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis for vaginitis symptoms.  
* The patient's embarrassment and hesitation ('Stigma or Shame,' 'Emotional Layer') in discussing symptoms, particularly the odor, underscores the need for a sensitive and non-judgmental approach from healthcare providers to facilitate open communication and accurate history taking. Her douching practice, potentially driven by this shame, is a direct risk factor.

### **Part 11: Management & Treatment Plan – *Bacterial Vaginosis***

#### **🧪 Pre-Treatment & Baseline Investigations (Beyond Initial Diagnostics)**

| Investigation | Purpose | Relevant Drug(s) This Informs |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Pregnancy Test (Urine hCG) | Rule out pregnancy before certain Rx choices | Metronidazole, Clindamycin |
| Allergy History | Ensure no contraindications to prescribed Rx | Metronidazole, Clindamycin |

*(Routine STI screening as per NACO guidelines (HIV, Syphilis, Hepatitis B/C) should be offered, especially given any new partner or inconsistent condom use, though not directly informing BV treatment itself in this monogamous patient without other STI red flags.)*

#### **🔁 Monitoring During & After Treatment**

| Time Point | Test/Observation | Purpose | Specific Drug(s) Monitored |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| End of treatment (Day 7-10) | Clinical symptom resolution (discharge, odor) | Assess initial treatment efficacy | Metronidazole/Clindamycin |
| 1 month (if symptoms persist/recur) | Re-evaluation, repeat wet mount/pH | Confirm recurrence vs. other cause |  |
| 3-6 months (for recurrent BV history) | Symptom review | Monitor for further recurrence |  |

#### **💊 Structured Treatment Plan**

* **✅ First-Line Treatment:** (As per NACO Guidelines for Vaginal Discharge Syndrome where BV is confirmed and cervicitis ruled out)  
  * **Metronidazole 500 mg PO BID × 7 days.** *Rationale: High efficacy, well-established, recommended by national guidelines.*  
  * OR **Metronidazole 0.75% vaginal gel, one full applicator (5 g) intravaginally, once daily for 5 days.** *Rationale: Effective local therapy, may have fewer systemic side effects.*  
  * OR **Clindamycin 2% vaginal cream, one full applicator (5 g) intravaginally, at bedtime for 7 days.** *Rationale: Alternative local therapy, particularly if metronidazole intolerance.*  
* **⚖️ Second-Line / Alternative Treatment(s):** (Generally for recurrence or specific situations)  
  * **Secnidazole 2 g orally, single dose.** *Rationale: Single-dose convenience, good efficacy.* (NACO includes this for vaginitis).  
  * **Clindamycin 300 mg PO BID × 7 days.** *Rationale: Oral alternative if topical clindamycin not preferred or if systemic treatment desired and metronidazole contraindicated/ineffective.*  
* **❌ Contraindicated / Generally Not Recommended Treatments:**  
  * **Routine treatment of asymptomatic male partners:** Not shown to reduce recurrence in female partner and not generally recommended.  
  * **Frequent or short courses of antibiotics without confirmed diagnosis:** Can lead to resistance and further dysbiosis.  
* **Suggested Concept Nodes for Treatment:**  
  1. **Antimicrobial Spectrum (Metronidazole/Clindamycin):** **Specific Relevance:** These antibiotics are effective against the anaerobic bacteria (e.g., *Gardnerella vaginalis*, *Prevotella spp.*, *Mobiluncus spp.*) that overgrow in BV, helping to restore the normal vaginal flora.  
  2. **Routes of Administration (Oral vs. Vaginal):** **Specific Relevance:** The choice between oral and vaginal therapy for BV in this patient allows for shared decision-making, considering efficacy, potential side effects (e.g., systemic effects of oral metronidazole vs. local effects of gel/cream), and patient preference.  
  3. **Management of Recurrence:** **Specific Relevance:** While this is a first episode, understanding that BV has a high recurrence rate is important for patient education and future management planning if symptoms return.

#### **🛡️ Supportive Care & Preventive Measures**

* Advise patient to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed.  
* Counsel to avoid vaginal douching, as it disrupts normal vaginal flora and can increase risk of BV.  
* Recommend using mild, unscented soaps for external genital hygiene.  
* Suggest wearing breathable cotton underwear and avoiding prolonged wear of tight, non-breathable clothing.  
* Discuss avoiding alcohol during and for 24 hours (for oral metronidazole) or 72 hours (for tinidazole, if used) after treatment with oral metronidazole to prevent disulfiram-like reaction.  
* Counsel that clindamycin cream (oil-based) may weaken latex condoms and diaphragms; advise alternative contraception or abstinence during and for 5 days after use.  
* Educate on symptoms of recurrence and when to seek re-evaluation.

#### **📈 Prognosis & 📅 Long-Term Outlook**

| Aspect | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| Expected Recovery | Symptom resolution typically within a few days of starting treatment; full resolution by end of course. |
| Risk of Recurrence | BV has a high recurrence rate (up to 50-70% within 12 months for some populations). Lifestyle modifications may help reduce risk. |
| Complications (if untreated) | Increased risk of acquiring STIs (including HIV), PID, and adverse pregnancy outcomes (though not pregnant currently). |
| Long-term Follow-up | Routine follow-up not needed if symptoms resolve. Re-evaluate if symptoms recur or persist. |
| **Emotional Resolution Suggestion:** | Patient feels relieved after diagnosis and understanding the cause of her symptoms. She is motivated to follow the treatment and preventive advice to manage her condition and regain her confidence. |

*(Transition for educator: OSCE stations are complete. Now proceeding to the final section, Part 13: MCQs for Bacterial Vaginosis.)*

---

### **Part 13: MCQs – *Bacterial Vaginosis***

#### **❓ MCQ 1: Focus on Key Diagnostic Criterion**

Which of the following is one of Amsel's criteria for the diagnosis of Bacterial Vaginosis? A. Vaginal pH \< 4.5 B. Presence of motile trichomonads on wet mount C. Positive Whiff test (amine odor with 10% KOH) D. Presence of pseudohyphae on KOH mount

✅ **Correct Answer:** C **Explanation for Correct Answer:** A positive Whiff test, indicating the presence of volatile amines, is one of the four Amsel's criteria for BV. **Rationale for Each Incorrect Option:**

* A \= Vaginal pH \> 4.5 (elevated) is a criterion; pH \< 4.5 is normal or seen in candidiasis.  
* B \= Motile trichomonads are diagnostic for Trichomoniasis, not BV.  
* D \= Pseudohyphae are diagnostic for Vulvovaginal Candidiasis, not BV.

#### **❓ MCQ 2: Focus on Pathophysiology/Risk Factor**

Which of the following practices is a known risk factor for developing Bacterial Vaginosis? A. Regular use of oral contraceptive pills B. Frequent vaginal douching C. Daily intake of probiotic yogurt D. Use of latex condoms during intercourse

✅ **Correct Answer:** B **Explanation for Correct Answer:** Frequent vaginal douching disrupts the normal vaginal flora, reducing lactobacilli and allowing overgrowth of BV-associated anaerobic bacteria. **Rationale for Each Incorrect Option:**

* A \= Oral contraceptives are not consistently shown to be a significant risk factor for BV; some studies show no effect or even a protective one.  
* C \= Probiotic yogurt (especially consumed orally) has limited evidence for preventing BV, though some research explores direct vaginal probiotic use. It's not a risk factor.  
* D \= Consistent condom use is generally associated with a *reduced* risk of BV and other STIs.

#### **❓ MCQ 3: Focus on First-Line Treatment Principle**

A 28-year-old woman is diagnosed with her first episode of Bacterial Vaginosis. According to NACO guidelines, which of the following is an appropriate first-line treatment? A. Fluconazole 150 mg orally, single dose B. Metronidazole 500 mg orally, twice daily for 7 days C. Azithromycin 1 g orally, single dose D. Topical acyclovir cream for 7 days

✅ **Correct Answer:** B **Explanation for Correct Answer:** Oral metronidazole (500 mg BID for 7 days) is a recommended first-line treatment for Bacterial Vaginosis according to major guidelines, including NACO. **Rationale for Each Incorrect Option:**

* A \= Fluconazole is used for Vulvovaginal Candidiasis.  
* C \= Azithromycin 1g is primarily used for Chlamydial infections.  
* D \= Topical acyclovir is used for Herpes Simplex Virus infections.
