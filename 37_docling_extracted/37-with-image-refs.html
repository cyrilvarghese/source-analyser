<h2>Definition</h2>
<h2>Lichen pLanus</h2>
<p>Lichenoid  disorders  are  inflammatory  dermatoses  characterized clinically by flat-topped, papular lesions and histologically by  a  lymphocytic  infiltrate  with  a  band-like  distribution  in  the papillary dermis [ 1 ]. Lichen planus is the prototype of lichenoid eruptions, but several skin diseases have a lichenoid tissue reaction and are included here [2,3]. Graft-versus-host disease, which often presents as a lichenoid eruption, is addressed separately in Chapter 38.</p>
<h2>Introduction and general description</h2>
<p>Lichen  planus  (LP),  the  most  typical  and  best  characterized lichenoid  dematosis,  is  an  idiopathic  inflammatory  skin  disease affecting the skin and mucosal membranes, often with a chronic course with relapses and periods of remission. Its prevalence is approximately 0.5% of the population (reviewed in [ 1 ]).</p>

<h2>epidemiology</h2>
<p>The incidence varies between 0.22% and 1% of the adult population worldwide. LP represented about 1.2% of all new dermatology patients in London and Turin [2], 0.9% in Copenhagen [3] and 0.38% in India [4]. Hypertrophic cases were reportedly to be common in Nigeria [5]. In contrast, oral LP seems to be more frequent with a reported incidence between 1% and 4% of the population [ 1 ].  LP  is  rare  in  children  and  commonly  affects  adults  during their fourth to sixth decade. There was an overrepresentation of South Asians in a series of childhood cases in Birmingham, UK [6]. There is no obvious racial predisposition for LP, although a small overrepresentation  with  patients  of  Indian  subcontinent  origin has been suggested at least in oral disease [7]. Familial cases are unusual but have been reported in association with HLA-A3, -A5, -B7, -DR1 and -DRB*0101.</p>
<h2>pathophysiology</h2>
<p>Lichen  planus  is  thought  to  be  a  T-cell-mediated  autoimmune disease, possibly targeting the basal keratinocytes, which can be triggered by a variety of situations, including viruses, drugs and contact allergens.</p>
<h2>Immunopathology</h2>
<p>The lymphocytic infiltrate of LP is composed of CD8 + T cells with a significant proportion of γ δ -T cells, which is unusual in the skin [1].  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies analysing the T-cell receptor genes of the lymphocytes of the inflammatory infiltrate of LP are generally oligoclonal and potentially suggest the presence of autoantigens [2]. Electron microscopy studies and immunohistochemistry of LP demonstrate an increased number of epidermal Langerhans cells [3]. Although autoimmunity is clearly suggested to be central in LP, the exact pathomechanisms are unclear. Gene expression studies of LP have demonstrated an up-regulation of type  I  interferon-inducible  genes  and  the  presence  of  a  specific chemokine signature; CXCL9, the ligand of the receptor CXCR3, was significantly increased in this study [ 4 ].  Global genetic studies of microRNAs (miRNA) in LP have revealed dysregulation in a number of miRNAs [5, ]. Involvement of the Th17 pathway for 6 LP has also been suggested [7]. That LP is thought to be an immunologically mediated disorder [8] is in part due to the fact that a lichenoid eruption may be seen as part of graft-versus-host disease [9-11].  Experimentally,  cloned  murine  autoreactive  T  cells  produce a lichenoid reaction in recipient animals following injection [12]. In LP lesions, T cells, both CD4 + and CD8 + , accumulate in the dermis, whereas CD8 + T cells infiltrate the epidermis. It has been proposed  that  CD8 + cytotoxic  T  cells  recognize  an  antigen  (currently unknown) associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC)  class  I  on  lesional  keratinocytes,  and  lyse  them  [13-17]. T-cell  receptor  repertoires  are  skewed  in  tissue  samples  and  in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with oral LP [2].</p>
<p>The role of chemokines in the pathophysiology of lichenoid tissue reactions has been suggested with regard to recruitment and local activation of cytotoxic TH1 cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Infiltrating CD8 + T cells, as well as keratinocytes, express a variety of different chemokines [18-20]. RANTES (regulated upon activation,  normal  T-cell  expressed  and  secreted)  secreted  by  T cells may trigger mast cell degranulation with a consequent release of tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα ),  which in turn up-regulates lesional T-cell RANTES secretion. Such mechanisms may contribute to the chronicity of T-cell infiltration and clinical disease [21].</p>
<p>Finally, keratinocytes probably contribute to the disease and are also type I interferon producers in LP skin lesions [ 4 ].   Keratinocytederived  cytokines  may  up-regulate  the  expression  of  cell  surface  adhesion  molecules  on,  and  migration  by,  T  cells  [22-24]. CD1a  Langerhans cells and factor XIIIa + + cells are increased in LP [3,15,25] and may be involved in antigen presentation to T cells. Activin A - a transforming growth factor β (TGFβ ) family member induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines and which promotes Langerhans  cell  differentiation  and  activation  -  is  increased  in the upper epidermis and dermis in LP [26]. Vascular endothelial expression of the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) is also elevated [15]. Mast cell degranulation [27], and T-cell secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) [28], may contribute to basement membrane disruption, enabling migration of CD8 + T cells into the epithelium. Granzyme B + T cells have been observed close to apoptotic keratinocytes [29]. Overexpression of bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP-4), another member of the TGFβ family, may contribute to apoptosis of epithelial cells in oral LP through up-regulation of p53, MMP-1 and MMP-3 [30]. Overexpression of MMP-2, membrane type 1 MMP and, especially, MMP-9 may be involved in malignant transformation in oral LP [31]. The role of c-Myc gains and overexpression in malignant transformation has also been established [32]. Myc is a transcription factor that is often dysregulated in cancers. The immune dysregulation and cytokine expression in LP has been reviewed [33].</p>
<h2>Causative organisms</h2>
<p>Several studies have suggested a role for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in  LP,  particularly  in  Japanese  and  Mediterranean  populations [34-39].  This  association  has  also  been  reported  in  other  countries including the USA, Germany, Italy, Spain and Iran but this is  not  a  consistent  observation  [40-43].  No  association  between LP and HCV was detected in France and England or India [44]. The role played by HCV in triggering LP remains unclear. Interestingly, tetramer analysis showed that HCV-specific CD8 + T cells with functional characteristics of terminally differentiated effector cells were identified in close vicinity to HCV (detected by PCR) in lesions of oral LP [45].</p>
<p>Other viruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of LP, including  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV)  [46,47],  human  herpesvirus  6 (HHV-6) and HHV-7 [48] and varicella zoster virus [49,50]. Finally, a number of reports have described the presence of LP after various  vaccines.  Typically,  hepatitis  B  vaccines  have  been  shown in some patients to trigger LP, often after the second injection of vaccine [51,52].</p>
<h2>Genetics</h2>
<p>There  may  be  a  genetic  susceptibility  to  idiopathic  LP.  Familial cases are reported [53-58], and a familial incidence of 10.7% was quoted in one series [56]. LP has also been reported in monozygotic</p>
<p>twins [59,60]. An association with HLA-A3 and HLA-5 has been documented  [61],  although  others  found  no  such  association [62,63], as have associations with HLA-B7 [53], HLA-A28 in Jewish people with LP and carbohydrate intolerance [64], HLA-DR1 [65], HLA-DR10 [66] and HLA-DRB1*0101 [67]. Genetic heterogeneity in LP has led to the suggestion that idiopathic cutaneous, and purely mucosal, LP may each have a different pathogenesis [68]. An association between LP and polymorphisms in CIITA, the MHC class II transactivator, has been reported in a Chinese cohort of LP patients [69]. Another association has been reported between LP and TNFα gene polymorphisms [70].</p>
<h2>environmental factors</h2>
<p>Environmental factors including drugs, contact allergens and others have been potentially associated with LP.</p>
<ul>
<li>· Drugs . A large variety of drugs has been linked with cutaneous eruptions similar or identical to LP. Often the terms LP-like eruption or lichenoid eruption are used in the context of an adverse drug reaction with features of LP. The list of drugs causing LP and LP-like eruptions has grown steadily and includes several classes,  including  antimicrobials,  antihypertensives,  antimalarials, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, diuretics, metals, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and more recently imatinib [71], intravenous immunoglobulin [72], etanercept [72] and  adalimumab  [73].  These  reactions  are  described  in  more detail in Chapter 118.</li>
<li>· Dental amalgam . Another putative antigen in oral LP is mercury in  dental  amalgam  [74],  however  more  recent  studies  do  not confirm  a  clear  association  between  LP  and  dental  amalgam [75].</li>
<li>· Betel  nut.  Social  use  of  the  betel  nut  is  relatively  common  in India  and  South-East Asia.  The  product  that  is  chewed,  betel quid,  is  a  mixture  of  substances,  including  the  areca  nut  and betel leaf, and is associated with oral LP [76,77].</li>
<li>· Lichen  planus-like  contact  dermatitis .  An  LP-like  eruption  was reported in up to 25% of persons exposed to chemicals found in colour developer. Current automated equipment minimizes contact  with  these,  and  LP-like  eruptions  due  to  this  source are now rare [78]. Two types of reaction were observed - acute (eczematous) and subacute (lichenoid). Patch-test reactions were usually positive to the substituted para -phenylenediamine and were eczematous in nature, but might become lichenoid [79]. LP-like lesions have developed on sites exposed to methacrylic acid esters used in the car industry [78], and more recently from dimethylfumarate, which can be found in sofas [81].</li>
<li>· Miscellaneous. LP  has  been induced by radiotherapy, and confined to a radiation field [80]. Anxiety, depression and stress are common in patients with LP [83] and may be risk factors for its development [84].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clinical features</h2>
<h2>history and clinical presentation</h2>
<p>The  classic  clinical  presentation  of  LP  includes  primary  lesions consisting  of  firm,  shiny,  polygonal,  1-3  mm  diameter  papules with a red to violet colour. More closely, a tracery of thin white</p>

<p>lines  can  be  seen  on  the  surface  of  the  lesions,  known  as  Wickham's striae (Figure 37.1) [1]. Papules can be isolated or grouped, in a linear or annular distribution. Typically, a greyish brown pigmentation can be observed in lesions that have resolved due to deposition of melanin in the superficial dermis. Annular lesions are especially common on the penis (Figure 37.2) and rarely may be the predominant type of lesion present, later leading to atrophy [2]. A variant in which groups of 'spiny' lesions resembling keratosis pilaris develop around hair follicles (lichen planopilaris) is not</p>

<p>uncommon (Figure  37.3).  Lichen  planopilaris  more  often  forms only a minor feature of the disease, but occasionally this type of lesion  may  predominate.  Co-localization  of  LP  and  vitiligo  has been reported [3]. LP can affect any part of the body surface, but is most often seen on the volar aspect of the wrists (Figure 37.4), the lumbar region and around the ankles. The ankles and shins are the commonest sites for hypertrophic lesions. When the palms and soles are affected, the lesions tend to be firm and rough with a yellowish hue (Figure 37.5) [4]. A rare, erosive, flexural variant of LP has been described [5]. Linear LP occurring on Blashko's lines can</p>

<p>Mucous  membrane  lesions  are  very  common,  occurring  in 30-70%  of  cases,  and  may  be  present  without  evidence  of  skin lesions. They are, however, much less common in black people. The  buccal  mucosa  and  tongue  are  most  often  involved,  but lesions  may  be  found  around  the  anus,  on  the  genitalia,  in  the larynx and, very rarely, on the tympanic membranes or even in</p>

<p>(Figure  37.8).  There  may  be  striking  pigmentation  of  oral  LP  in darkly  pigmented  races  [14].  Diabetes  is  a  possible  associated disease of oral LP [15,16], and candidiasis may coexist with LP in some patients.</p>
<p>Pruritus is a fairly consistent feature in LP and ranges from occasional mild irritation to more or less continuous, severe   itching, which  interferes  with  sleep  and  makes  life  almost  intolerable; occasionally, pruritus is completely absent. Hypertrophic lesions usually  itch  severely.  Paradoxically,  there  is  seldom  evidence  of scratching, as the patient tends to rub to gain relief. Itching at sites without visible skin lesions can occur. Burning and stinging are less common complaints. In the mouth, the patient may complain of  discomfort,  stinging  or  pain;  ulcerated  lesions  are  especially painful. Great discomfort may be caused by hot foods and drinks.</p>
<h2>Clinical variants</h2>
<h2>Lichen planus principally involving mucous membranes</h2>
<p>Lesions  confined  to  the  mouth,  or  with  minimal  accompanying skin involvement, are not uncommon [1-6], and account for about 15% of all cases. Mucosal lichen sclerosis/lichen planus overlap syndrome can also be observed [1]. The prevalence of oral LP was 1.5% among the villagers of Kerala in southern India [7], possibly related to chewing tobacco, and ranges between 0.5% and 2.2% in other epidemiological studies [2,8]. The lesions do not differ from those found in connection with skin lesions, but, being confined to the mouth, may lead to great difficulty in diagnosis. They are often referred first to a dental surgeon. Distinct clinical subtypes such as reticular, atrophic, hypertrophic and erosive forms are well recognized, and more than one type may be present [2]. On the tongue and buccal mucosa, lesions are most likely to be mistaken for leukoplakia and on the gum margin for gingivitis or chronic candidiasis; the latter may coexist. Other conditions that must be excluded are 'smoker's patches', which characteristically involve the palate,</p>
<p>and white-sponge naevi, in which the mucous membrane is thickened, irregularly folded and feels soft to the touch. These occur mainly on the floor of the mouth and histologically many of the prickle cells in the epidermis are vacuolated. It is important to bear in mind the possibility of a lichenoid drug reaction in patients with oral lichenoid changes (see Chapter 110). Oral lichenoid reactions may be asymmetrical on the buccal mucosa and occur adjacent to dental amalgam fillings. If patch testing reveals mercury allergy, changing to another type of filling may prove beneficial [9-14]. Very occasionally, LP lesions extend to the larynx or oesophagus [15-19]. Oesophageal LP may result in dysphagia and the formation of benign strictures.</p>
<p>In young men, the lesions of LP are sometimes restricted to the genitalia and/or mouth [20,21]. Genital lesions, which are usually characteristic, may be present on the penile shaft (see Figure 37.2), glans penis, prepuce or scrotum. Ulceration is very unlikely, and syphilis can usually be excluded without difficulty. The presence of buccal mucosal lesions will usually confirm the diagnosis. Circumcision may be helpful in clearing up LP [20].</p>
<p>Lesions on the female genitalia are fairly common [22-29]; they may occur  alone,  be  combined  with  lesions  in  the  mouth  only, or be part of widespread involvement. The clinical presentation of LP of the vulva spans a spectrum from subtle, fine, reticulate papules to severe erosive disease accompanied by dyspareunia, scarring and loss of the normal vulvar architecture. The condition should be distinguished from lichen sclerosus or leukoplakia, but this may be difficult when there is coexisting atrophy or vaginal stenosis. Diagnostic criteria have been proposed recently [30] and include well-demarcated erosions/erythematous areas at the vaginal  introitus,  the  presence  of  a  hyperkeratotic border to lesions and/or Wickham's striae in the surrounding skin, symptoms of pain/burning, scarring/loss of normal architecture, the presence of  vaginal  inflammation  and  the  involvement  of  other  mucosal surfaces. Histologically, a well-defined inflammatory band involving the dermal-epidermal junction and consisting predominantly of lymphocytes and signs of basal layer degeneration are seen. The association of erosive LP of the vulva and vagina with desquamative  gingivitis  has  been  termed  the  vulvo-vaginal-gingival  syndrome (Figure 37.9) [21,22]. Coexisting vulval lichen sclerosus and lichenoid oral lesions have been described [31].</p>
<h2>Lichen planopilaris</h2>
<h2>Synonyms and inclusions</h2>
<ul>
<li>•	 Follicular lichen planus</li>
</ul>
<p>Follicular lesions usually appear during the course of typical LP, but occasionally they predominate and diagnosis may then be difficult. An absence of arrector pili muscles and sebaceous glands, a  perivascular  and  perifollicular  lymphocytic  infiltrate  in  the reticular  dermis  and  mucinous  perifollicular  fibroplasia  within the  upper  dermis  with  an  absence  of  interfollicular  mucin,  and superficial perifollicular wedge-shaped scarring are all characteristic features of the histology [1]. Presentation with alopecia of the trunk is recorded [2]. Follicular lesions occurring in the scalp are accompanied by some scaling and are likely to lead to a scarring alopecia  (Figure  37.10).  Very  rarely,  the  scalp  alone  is  involved.</p>

<p>The  so-called  Graham  Little-Piccardi-Lassueur  syndrome  comprises the triad of multifocal scalp cicatricial alopecia, non-scarring alopecia of the axillae and/or groin, and keratotic lichenoid follicular papules [3-8]. The clinical, histological and immunofluorescence  overlap  between  this  syndrome  and  LP  with  follicular involvement (lichen planopilaris) suggest that both are variants of LP. Follicular LP must be distinguished by biopsy from keratosis pilaris, Darier disease, follicular mucinosis, lichen scrofulosorum and, in the scalp, from lupus erythematosus.</p>

<p>Frontal fibrosing alopecia is a scalp condition that affects elderly women in particular and frequently involves the eyebrows. It has been regarded by some authors as a clinically distinct variant of lichen planopilaris [9] but is considered by most to be a variant [10], and is certainly associated with mucocutaneous LP [11,12].</p>
<h2>hypertrophic lichen planus</h2>
<p>This usually develops during the course of a subacute attack, but occasionally only hypertrophic or warty lesions are found. They most often occur on the lower limbs, especially around the ankles; venous  stasis  has  been  put  forward  as  an  explanation  (Fig  ure 37.11).  The  development  of  hypertrophic  lesions  greatly  lengthens the course of the disease, as they may persist for many years. When such lesions eventually clear, an area of pigmentation and scarring may remain and there is often some degree of atrophy. They must be distinguished from lichen simplex chronicus and lichen amyloidosus (papular). Multiple cutaneous horns overlying hypertrophic LP are recorded [1], as are keratoacanthoma [2,3] and malignant transformation [4-6] arising in hypertrophic LP, as well as   metastatic squamous cell cancer [7].</p>
<h2>Lichen planus of the palms and soles</h2>
<p>Although lesions on the volar aspect of the wrists or at the ankles occur  in  more  than  50%  of  cases  of  LP,  lesions  on  the  adjacent palms and soles are less common, lack the characteristic shape and colour of lesions elsewhere, and are firm to the touch and yellow in hue (see Figure 37.5) [1]. They may be broadly sheeted or show up  as  punctate  keratoses  [2].  Vesicle-like  papules  are  recorded [3]. Itching may be absent. When such changes occur in isolation,</p>

<p>diagnosis is very difficult; syphilis, psoriasis, callosities and warts must be excluded.</p>
<p>A rare, very chronic form of LP involves large, painful, indolent ulcers  on  the  sole  of  one  or  both  feet  [4],  with  gradual,  permanent loss of the toenails; there may be secondary webbing of the toes [5]. The sole may resemble lichenified dermatitis or psoriasis rather than LP before the ulcers appear. The onset is insidious and there may be no other evidence of LP, although cicatricial alopecia has been associated in some cases.</p>
<h2>actinic lichen planus</h2>
<h2>Synonyms and inclusions</h2>
<ul>
<li>•	 Lichen planus subtropicus</li>
</ul>
<p>'Actinic' or (sub)tropical LP generally occurs in children or young adults with dark skin living in tropical countries; virtually all cases originate from the Middle East, East Africa or India [6-10]. Lesions occur on exposed skin (usually the face) as well-defined annular or discoid patches, which have a deeply hyperpigmented centre surrounded by a striking hypopigmented zone (Figure 37.12). Erythematous actinic LP has been associated with oral erosive LP and chronic active hepatitis [11]. Sunlight exposure appears to be central to the pathogenesis of actinic LP [12], although evidence for photo-induction of lesions in actinic LP is still lacking [13]. Actinic LP may mimic melasma [14]. There is a histological spectrum comprising: a form with features of classic idiopathic LP; an intermediate  form  (lichenoid  melanodermatitis)  with  foci  of  spongiosis and parakeratosis; and a more overtly eczematous type [15]. All</p>
<figure><img src="37-with-image-refs_artifacts%5Cimage_000013_6cee397f36bc454d914dc584730ec763b3332dde4f100a0fe9b1ffa99eacfc10.png"></figure>
<p>share striking pigmentary incontinence. Some of these 'hybrids' of actinic LP may not be mere variants of LP.</p>
<h2>Lichen planus pigmentosus</h2>
<p>This  is  a  pigmentary  disorder  seen  in  India  or  in  the  Middle East, which may or may not be associated with typical LP papules [16-18]. The macular hyperpigmentation involves chiefly the face, neck and upper limbs, although it can be more widespread, and varies from slate grey to brownish black. It is mostly diffuse, but  reticular,  blotchy  and  perifollicular  forms  are  seen  [3,18]. The duration at presentation ranged from 2 months to 21 years in one series [18]. Occasionally, there is a striking predominance of lesions at intertriginous sites, especially the axillae [19,20]. The mucous membranes, palms and soles are usually not involved, but involvement of mucous membranes has been observed [21]. LP pigmentosus has been anecdotally reported in association with acrokeratosis of Bazex [22].</p>
<h2>annular lichen planus</h2>
<figure><figcaption><div class="caption">Figure 37.12 Lichen planus actinicus showing well-defined, pigmented, nummular patches on the face.

<p>Although small annular lesions are common in LP, cases showing  a  few  large  annular  lesions  only  are  unusual.  They  may  be widely scattered,  and  usually  have  a  very  narrow  rim  of  activity  and  a  depressed,  slightly  atrophic  centre  (Figure  37.13)  [23]. Much less often, the margin is wide and the central area is quite small. Annular  lesions  are  characteristically  found  on  the  penis (see Figure 37.2), sometimes associated with lesions on the buccal mucosa. The differential diagnosis includes granuloma annulare.</p>

<p>A  distinct  entity  termed  annular  lichenoid  dermatitis  of  youth [2,3,24,25] has been described, characterized by   persistent, asymptomatic erythematous macules and round, annular patches with a red-brownish border and central hypopigmentation, mostly distributed on the groin and flanks, in children and adolescents. Histology reveals a lichenoid dermatitis with necrosis/apoptosis of the keratinocytes limited to the tips of rete ridges.</p>
<h2>Guttate lichen planus</h2>
<p>Lesions are widely scattered and remain discrete, may be all small (1-2  mm across),  or  larger  (up  to  1  cm),  and  individual  lesions seldom become chronic (Figure 37.14). Guttate psoriasis must be excluded as a differentiatial.</p>
<h2>acute and subacute lichen planus with a confluence of lesions</h2>
<p>In these forms, small lesions are widely distributed; where they become  confluent,  eczema  may  be  simulated.  Colour  changes may be marked, with individual lesions initially red but progressing  rapidly  to  black  as  they  fade.  Successive  crops  may  occur, such that the total time for clearance may be little different from other forms. A small minority clear in under 3 months. Differential diagnosis includes pityriasis rosea in the earliest phase, and eczema later; drug-induced lichenoid eruptions may present in this fashion.</p>
<h2>'Mixed' lichen planus/discoid lupus erythematosus disease patterns</h2>
<p>Discoid  lupus  erythematosus  (DLE)  and  LP  are  usually  considered as distinct entities with characteristic clinical, histopathological and immunopathological features, with basement membrane deposition of IgG in DLE [1,2]. However, similarities between LP and DLE have been noted. In addition, there have been several reports  of  patients  showing  overlapping  features  of  both  disorders  [3-8].  Chronic  atrophic  DLE-like  lesions  on  the  head,  neck and  upper  trunk  may  accompany  reticular  white  lesions  in  the oral cavity, and combinations of lichenoid or verrucous lesions are</p>

<p>seen. Eyelid involvement is recorded [9]. The association of extensive generalized LP with subacute cutaneous DLE has also been documented [10].</p>
<h2>Bullous lichen planus and lichen planus pemphigoides</h2>
<p>Lichen ruber pemphigoides was first described by Kaposi in 1892. Bullous LP and LP pemphigoides were in the past differentiated solely on clinical and histological criteria [1], but can now be differentiated using immunofluorescence (IMF) procedures and immunoelectron microscopy. In bullous LP, blisters arise only on or near the lesions of LP, as a result of severe liquefaction degeneration of the basal cell layer [3]. Histologically, there is subepidermal bulla formation with typical changes of LP, and direct and indirect IMF are negative [2,3]. The eruption is usually only of short duration [2]. In LP pemphigoides the LP tends to be acute and generalized and is followed by the sudden appearance of large bullae on both involved and uninvolved skin (Figure 37.15) [4-7]. Occasionally, even in LP pemphigoides, blisters may arise only on the lesions of LP [8]. LP pemphigoides has been precipitated by psoralen and UVA (PUVA) [9] and has evolved into pemphigoid nodularis [10]. An LP pemphigoides-like eruption has been reported to overlap with paraneoplastic pemphigus [11,12]. In LP pemphigoides, the histology shows a subepidermal bulla with no evidence of associated  LP  [2].  Direct  IMF  shows  linear  basement  membrane  zone deposition of IgG and C3 in perilesional skin [2,7]. Immunoelectron microscopic studies reveal deposition of IgG and C3 in the base of the bulla and not in the roof as found in bullous pemphigoid [13].</p>
<p>Immunoblotting data have revealed that  circulating  autoantibodies in LP pemphigoides react with an epitope within the Cterminal NC16A domain of bullous pemphigoid 180 kDa antigen, and also with a 200 kDa antigen detected in bullous pemphigoid [14-18]. It seems that epidermal damage from liquefaction degeneration in LP exposes basement membrane antigens, and a consequent stimulation of autoantibody production. The mean age of patients with LP pemphigoides is lower than that of those with</p>

<p>classic  bullous  pemphigoid,  and  the  course  of  the  disease  also tends to be less severe.</p>
<h2>Lichen nitidus</h2>
<p>Lichen nitidus is a rarer condition than idiopathic LP and is characterized clinically by the presence of pinpoint to pinhead-sized papules,  which  are  usually  asymptomatic  and  flesh-coloured, with a flat, shiny surface. The view that lichen nitidus represents a variant of LP tends to be supported by the fact that early, tiny LP papules may be clinically and histopathologically indistinguishable from lichen nitidus. Immunophenotypic studies also reinforce the association between LP and lichen nitidus [1]. However, some authors favour a separation into two dermatoses because of histopathological differences, or differences in cytokine expression in lichen nitidus [2].</p>
<p>Typical lichen nitidus papules are minute, pinpoint to pinhead sized, and have a flat or dome-shaped, shiny surface. They usually remain discrete, although they may be closely grouped (Figure 37.16). They are found on any part of the body but the sites of predilection are the forearms, penis (Figure 37.17), abdomen, chest and buttocks. The eruption is sometimes generalized [3,4]. When the palms or soles are involved the changes can be those of a confluent hyperkeratosis resembling chronic fissured eczema, or there may be multiple, distinctive, minute papules [5,6]. On the palms, the  minute papules can become purpuric and may occasionally resemble pompholyx. Such cases may lack lesions of lichen nitidus elsewhere, so a biopsy is essential to confirm the diagnosis [5,7].</p>
<p>Linear lichen nitidus has been described, but is exceptionally rare  [8].  The  development  of  lesions  along  scratch  marks  is  not uncommon.  The  lesions  are  flesh  coloured  or  reddish  brown. Although intense pruritus can occur [4], the lesions are generally quite symptomless. Nail pitting may coexist with lichen nitidus [9], or the affected nails may appear rough due to increased linear striations and longitudinal ridging [5,10]. An actinic variant has been documented [11]. Mucous membrane lesions occur occasionally and are much rarer than in LP. Lichen nitidus must be distinguished from lichen scrofulosorum [12], where there are follicular</p>

<p>papules grouped in small patches on the trunk, and from keratosis pilaris,  where  there  are  horny  follicular  papules  mainly  on  the extensor surface of the limbs. In cases of doubt, a biopsy usually clarifies the diagnosis. Lichen nitidus has been described in association with Crohn disease, trisomy 21, congenital megacolon [13] and Niemann-Pick disease type B [14].</p>
<p>Surprisingly, direct IMF studies in lichen nitidus have given negative results [15,16]. However, ultrastructural studies have shown identical changes in lichen nitidus and LP [15]. The histology of a typical papule is characteristic. The papule is formed by an intense infiltrate  situated  immediately  below  the  epidermis  and  is  well circumscribed. The infiltrate consists of lymphocytes and histiocytes and there are often a few Langhans giant cells (Figure 37.18). Sometimes, plasma cells are numerous in the infiltrate [17]. The overlying epidermis is flattened and sometimes there is liquefaction degeneration of the basal cell layer. The rete ridges at the margin of the infiltrate are elongated and tend to encircle it. Although tuberculoid  in  appearance,  true  tubercle  formation  or  caseation never occurs. The histology of a palmar lesion may show a deep parakeratotic plug, which distinguishes it from the palmar lesions of LP [7]. Perifollicular granulomas can occur in spinous and follicular  lichen  nitidus,  which may simulate lichen scrofulosorum [12].  Perforating  lichen  nitidus  has  also  been  described  [18].  In its  characteristic  monomorphic  form,  lichen  nitidus  is  rare,  but lesions of lichen nitidus occurring in association with LP are more common. The age incidence tends to be lower than that of LP. Most cases occur in children or young adults. Familial lichen nitidus has rarely been observed [19].</p>

</ul>
<p>The variety of synonyms used implies that there is no complete consensus of agreement about this rare disorder. The great majority of cases are adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years [1], although children are occasionally affected [2]. Nékam disease is characterized by violaceous, papular and nodular lesions typically arranged in a linear and reticulate pattern (Figure 37.19), most marked on the extremities and buttocks, and accompanied by a seborrhoeic dermatitis-like  eruption  on  the  face.  Nékam's  original  case  was also  associated  with  palmoplantar  keratoderma.  The  individual lesions are erythematous verrucous papules covered by a hyperkeratotic  plug  that  can  only  be  removed  with  difficulty,  revealing irregular indentations and prominent capillary loops [1,3]. In extensive Nékam disease, the lesions tend to be symmetrical bilaterally, mainly involving the antecubital fossae, extensor forearms, lumbosacral area and buttocks, posterior thighs, popliteal fossae and less commonly the oral cavity and genitalia. Oral manifestations occur in 50% of patients - recurrent aphthous ulcers, larger chronic ulcers or erythrokeratotic papules being the commonest oral features [4]. The nails can become thickened, longitudinally ridged and prone to paronychia [5]. Cases have followed trauma [6] and erythroderma [7]. A limited variant of Nékam disease presenting with   erythematous hyperkeratotic   papules and plaques on the face, clearing in the summer months, has been described in two young siblings [8]. Histologically, changes are often non-specific and consistent  with  a  chronic  dermatitis,  but  lichenoid  features can be seen [1,3]. Some authors believe that the condition is an unusual variant of LP [1], while others consider it to be a distinct entity [9]. A case of Nékam disease associated with porokeratotic histology and amyloid deposition may also point against the view</p>

<h2>Complications</h2>
<h2>hair</h2>
<p>Alopecia  is  uncommon  in  LP,  but  most  often  occurs  in  small areas on the scalp, producing patches of atrophic cicatricial alopecia (see Figure 37.10) [1-5]. It results from follicular destruction by  the  inflammatory  infiltrate,  with  scarring.  Areas  of  alopecia may   continue to appear, or to extend, for months after the skin lesions have faded. The final result is one of pseudopelade [2,5]; this  is  probably  best  considered  as  a  distinct  clinical  entity  due to a number of independent conditions, of which LP is only one. Lichen planopilaris is more common in women and about half will develop involvement of the glabrous skin, mucous membranes or</p>
<p>nails [1]; it may occur in children [3]. Tumid forms of LP follicularis have been described in which clusters of milium cysts and comedones develop [6]. LP pilaris has been reported in association with dermatitis herpetiformis [7].</p>
<h2>Nails</h2>
<p>Nail involvement occurs in up to 10% of cases, but is usually a minor feature of the disease [8,9]. The majority of cases present during the fifth or sixth decades. Long-term permanent damage to the nails is rare [10]. Fingernails are more frequently affected than toenails [10], with initial involvement of two or three fingernails before subsequent involvement of the remaining digits. The most common changes are exaggeration of the longitudinal lines and linear depressions due to slight thinning of the nail plate (Figure 37.20). These changes usually occur in the context of severe generalized LP, although skin lesions may not be seen in the vicinity  of  the  affected  nail.  Elevated  ridges may be seen on the nail [9]. Adhesion between the epidermis of the dorsal nail fold and the nail bed may cause partial destruction of the nail (pterygium unguis) (Figure 37.21a). Rarely, the nail is completely shed; there is  usually  clinical  evidence  of  LP  at  the  base  of  the  nail  before shedding.  Nails  may  partially  regrow  or  be  permanently  lost (Figure 37.21b); the nails of the great toes are the ones most often affected. LP has been shown to cause childhood idiopathic atrophy of the nails [11]. LP of the nails in childhood is rare [12] but may overlap with the condition of twenty-nail dystrophy of childhood (idiopathic trachyonychia); the exact relationship is unclear [13-18]. The rare variant of LP that causes ulceration of the soles is</p>

<h2>Mucous membranes</h2>
<p>Squamous cell  carcinoma  developing  on  oral  lesions  is  uncommon but is a potential danger, especially with ulcerated lesions</p>
<figure><figcaption><div class="caption">Figure 37.22 Squamous carcinoma on the lower lip developing at the site of lichen planus cheilitis.

<p>[22-30], although the incidence varies greatly in different series. Lesions may occur on the lip (Figure 37.22), the buccal mucosa or the gum margin. It has been postulated that the high expression of  cyclo-oxygenase 2 reported in oral LP may be of aetiological significance in the development of squamous cell carcinoma [31]. Squamous cell carcinoma arising on cutaneous lesions of LP [32] and ano-genital lesions [33-35] is definitely a rare phenomenon. Cicatricial conjunctivitis [36] and lacrimal canalicular obstruction are recorded [37].</p>
<h2>associated conditions</h2>
<p>Idiopathic  LP  has  been  reported  in  association  with  diseases  of altered or disturbed immunity, including ulcerative colitis [1-3], alopecia areata [3,4], vitiligo [3], dermatomyositis [5], morphoea and lichen sclerosus [6], systemic lupus erythematosus [7,8], pemphigus [7] and paraneoplastic pemphigus [9,10]. In addition, LP has been observed in association with thymoma [4,7,11,12], hypothyroidism [13], myasthenia gravis [2,3,12], hypogammaglobulinaemia  [4,5,14],  primary  biliary  cirrhosis  [15-17],  especially  in those treated with penicillamine, and primary sclerosing cholangitis [18]. The literature with regard to LP and HCV infection is reviewed in the section on pathogenesis. In Italy, possibly because of a higher prevalence of HBV and HCV infection, patients with LP seem more prone to develop liver disease, including chronic active hepatitis [19,20]. A high prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies has been documented in patients with HCV-associated oral LP [21]. Elsewhere, the association between LP and chronic active hepatitis  or  primary  biliary  cirrhosis  is  unusual  and  probably oincidental [22-24]. Overall, the majority of patients with LP live c to old age, despite an association with autoimmunity [25].</p>
<p>LP has also been associated with diabetes [26]. Anecdotally, LP has  occurred  in  patients  with  Castleman  tumours  (giant  lymph node  hyperplasia)  [27]  or  with  generalized  lichen  amyloidosus [28]. LP has been described in certain tattoo reactions, particularly in those areas where there is coexisting mercury hypersensitivity to the injected dye [29,30].</p>
<h2>Disease course and prognosis</h2>
<p>Although  a  few  cases  evolve  rapidly  and  clear  within  a  few weeks, the onset is usually insidious. In most cases, the papules eventually flatten after a few months, often to be replaced by an area  of  pigmentation  that  retains  the  shape  of  the  papule  and persists for months or years. There may be a gradual change in colour from pink to blue to black. The residual pigmentation may be intense, especially in dark-skinned races, or almost imperceptible in fair-skinned individuals. New papules may form while others are clearing. Some papules persist much longer, enlarge and thicken, and develop a roughened surface with a prominent violaceous  hue  -  so-called  hypertrophic  LP.  Such  lesions  may resolve  with  atrophy  or  scarring.  More  warty  lesions  are  seen occasionally. Areas of pigment loss are described in black South Africans.</p>
<h2>Investigations</h2>
<p>Histology is the most useful investigation to confirm a diagnosis of LP. More recently, the use of dermoscopy has been assessed and found useful in some cases when Wickham's striae can be visualized better with the device (Figure 37.23) [ 1 ]. Typical features  of  dermoscopy images of LP include a network of whitish  striae  with  red  globules  at  the  periphery  [ 1 ,2].  Histology will be routinely obtained to confirm the diagnosis of LP [3,4]. The earliest finding is an increase in epidermal Langerhans cells [3],  associated with a superficial perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes  and  histiocytes,  impinging  on  the  dermal-epidermal</p>

<p>junction (DEJ). Mild spongiosis is followed by vacuolar alteration and clefting along the DEJ, with accumulation of necrotic keratinocytes  (colloid  bodies)  [5].  The  characteristic  histological changes are best seen in biopsies of fully developed LP papules (Figure 37.24) [6]. The centre of the papule shows irregular acanthosis of the epidermis, irregular thickening of the granular layer and compact hyperkeratosis. The mid-  epidermal cells appear larger, flatter and paler than usual [6]. In oral LP, epithelial proliferation is increased [7]. Parakeratosis is rarely found in idiopathic LP, in contrast to some drug-induced lichenoid tissue reactions. A focal increase in thickness of the granular layer and infiltrate  corresponds  to  the  presence  of  Wickham's  striae  [8]. Degenerating basal epidermal cells are transformed into colloid bodies (15-20 μ m diameter), which appear singly or in clumps [9-11].  The  rete  ridges  may  appear  flattened  or  effaced  ( 'sawtooth' appearance ), and focal separation from the dermis may lead to  Max  Joseph  spaces  (Figure  37.25).  In  older  or  hypertrophic lesions, the number of colloid bodies is considerably reduced. In 'active' LP, a band-like infiltrate of  lymphocytes and histiocytes, rarely  admixed  with  plasma  cells  [12,13],  obliterates  the  DEJ. Epidermal  melanocytes  are  absent  or  considerably  decreased in number  [6], while pigmentary incontinence with dermal melanophages is    characteristic.  When  the  disease  is  becoming inactive, the infiltrate, with melanophages, becomes sparser and is  arranged  around  papillary  blood  vessels,  which  may  show ectasia and surrounding fibroplasia.</p>
<p>In hypertrophic LP, the epidermis may show a pseudoepitheliomatous appearance with extreme irregular acanthosis.   Follicles may be expanded and at times have a cyst-like appearance. The infiltrate may not appear very band-like, but serial sections will usually show foci of basal cell liquefaction and colloid body formation,  often  around  the  follicular  epithelium.  Longstanding cases usually demonstrate coexistent dermal fibrosis adjacent to the inflammatory changes.</p>
<p>In atrophic LP, the epidermis may be greatly thinned almost to the level of the granular layer, although relatively compact hyperkeratosis remains. The rete ridges are usually completely effaced</p>

<p>with  relatively  few  colloid  bodies.  The  papillary  dermis  shows fibrosis and loss of elastica.</p>
<p>In follicular lesions, an infiltrate extends around, and may permeate, the base of the hair follicle epithelium, with follicular keratin plugging (Figure 37.26) [14,15].</p>
<p>In mucosal LP, the epithelium is usually thinned with parakeratosis, although both types of keratinization may be seen [16,17]. The epithelium may resemble epidermis from the skin, plasma cells  may  be  prominent  in  the  band-like  infiltrate,  and  colloid bodies are fewer than in typical cutaneous papular LP. The erythematous subtype of oral LP is associated with increased cell proliferation  compared  with  the  reticular  form  [18].  Moderate or severe epithelial dysplasia on oral biopsy should probably be regarded as an increased risk for subsequent cancer development [19].</p>
<p>Bullous  LP  is  rare.  Blister  formation  takes  place  predominantly between the basal lamina and the cytomembranes of basal keratinocytes (i.e. intrabasal) [9], such that there is a wide separation between the epidermis and infiltrate.</p>
<p>Direct immunofluorescence shows globular deposits of immunoglobulin  M  (IgM)  (Figure  37.27)  and  occasionally  IgG  and  IgA, representing apoptotic keratinocytes, around the DEJ and lower epidermis, with fibrin deposition at the region of the DEJ [16,20]. Direct IMF studies may be useful in differentiating LP from lupus erythematosus or LP pemphigoides [21,22], and can be carried out on routine histological material (23).</p>
<p>A clinicopathological study of lichenoid dermatitis concluded that it  was  usually possible to provide a specific diagnosis [24].</p>

<p>Occasionally,  lichenoid  dermatitis  can  become  generalized  and clinically mimic an exfoliative dermatitis; such eruptions are usually triggered by drugs.</p>
<p>Benign  lichenoid  keratoses  are  usually  solitary  but  may  be multiple [25-27], and show characteristic lichenoid infiltrates of lymphocytes,  occasional  parakeratosis,  and  apoptotic  bodies  in the epidermis without nuclear atypia of keratinocytes. Rarely, the histology  may  show  features  of  mycosis  fungoides  [28].  Melanoma may be associated with a lichenoid tissue reaction [29], and</p>

<h2>Management</h2>
<p>Treatment  of  LP  can  represent  a  challenge  and  depends  on  the localization,  clinical  form  and  severity  [ 1 ]. For  cutaneous  LP, which can clear spontaneously within 1-2 years, the aim of treatment is to reduce pruritus and time to resolution [2]. Therapeutic abstention is recommended for asymptomatic oral LP. However, painful, erosive LP may need aggressive and long-term treatments [3]. Nail or scalp involvement [4,5], which may induce scars, genital LP [6] and oesophageal and conjunctival involvement, which may induce strictures and fibrosis, may require rapid treatment to avoid scaring or avoid a fatal course.</p>
<p>The main therapy for LP is corticosteroids. Overall, the level of evidence for treatments used in LP is low [ 7 ]. Surprisingly, there is still little evidence for the efficacy of topical or systemic corticosteroids, commonly recommended as first line treatment for LP. Treatment is mainly based on clinical experience. In contrast, for oral LP, there are several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one Cochrane review [ 7 ,8, 9 ].  However, the majority of these trials are small, have used various outcomes and are at high risk of bias. For cutaneous LP, there are only a few small RCTs. No RCT has assessed treatment for genital or nail LP, lichen planopilaris or other lichenoid disorders.</p>

<h2>Cutaneous lichen planus</h2>
<p>The goals of therapy are to improve itching and reduce time to resolution of the lesions.</p>
<h2>First line</h2>
<p>Topical  corticosteroids  are  the  first  line  treatment  for  limited cutaneous LP. The use of very potent corticosteroids is required (clobetasol propionate ointment 0.05%) once daily at night until remission.  If  no  evolution  is  observed  after  6  weeks,  second line therapy has to be considered. After remission, the optimal length of maintenance therapy is unknown and will be adapted to each patient. For hypertrophic LP, very potent corticosteroids need to be applied under an occlusive bandage. Oral corticosteroids are the first line treatment for widespread cutaneous LP: prednisolone 0.5-1 mg/kg per day until improvement (usually 4-6 weeks). In a small RCT in which potent corticosteroid cream alone  was  compared  with  oral  prednisolone  (30  mg  per  day for  10  days)  combined  with  topical  corticosteroids,  the  time to  clearing  was  significantly  shorter  in  the  oral  prednisolone group (18 weeks versus 29 weeks) than in the topical steroid cream  only  group.  Two  patients  in  the  corticosteroid  group experienced a severe relapse after treatment withdrawal [10]. After  remission,  oral  corticosteroids  should  be  tapered  down slowly.</p>
<h2>second line</h2>
<p>An RCT showing a rate of regression or remission at 8 weeks significantly higher with acitretin (30 mg per day for 8 weeks) than with placebo has been published [11]. Considering the side effects of teratogenicity and mucocutaneous dryness, acitretin is  used  as  second  line  therapy  in  cutaneous  LP. Another  second  line  option  is  photochemotherapy  or  phototherapy.  In  a small trial, PUVA used three times weekly on one side of the body was compared with no treatment on the other side of the body. Clearance was observed on the treated side only in 50% of the patients [12]. In a retrospective series, clearance within a  mean  of  3  months  was  observed  in  70%  of  patients  treated with narrow-band UVB therapy (13). PUVA phototherapy may also  be  combined with acitretin but evaluation of this association has not been assessed. Phototherapy can increase the risk of  residual  hyperpigmentation  in  dark-skinned  patients.  Oral corticosteroids  in  combination  with  phototherapy  are  also  a possible second line therapy.</p>
<h2>third line</h2>
<p>The  best  level  of  evidence  for  methotrexate  in  cutaneous  LP is  a  prospective  series.  A  complete  remission  was  observed in 14/24 patients at 24 weeks [14]. However, by analogy with other  cutaneous  diseases,  methotrexate  can  be  used  as  third line treatment for generalized LP. There are four RCTs assessing griseofulvin, hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine [15-17]. Because of risk of bias in these trials, discrepancies of results between studies  for  griseofulvin  and  life-threatening  adverse reaction  for  sulfasalazine,  these  treatments  are  not  recommended in cutaneous LP.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Oral lichen planus</h2>
<p>The aims of treatment are to heal erosive lesions in order to reduce pain  and  permit  normal  food  intake.  Education  of  the  patient should  emphasize  that  oral  LP  frequently  has  a  chronic  course marked by treatment-induced remission followed by relapse [4, 7 ]. Considering the potential higher risk of squamous cell carcinoma, the need for regular clinical surveillance on a long-term basis has also to be explained [18]. Alcohol and tobacco should be avoided as well as spicy or acidic foods and drinks. Good oral hygiene and professional dental care are recommended.</p>
<h2>First line</h2>
<p>Topical  corticosteroids  are  the  first  line  treatment  for  symptomatic oral LP. In two small RCTs comparing topical corticosteroids, higher cure rates were observed in the topical corticosteroids group (80% versus 30% with fluocinonide and 66% vsersus 18% with betamethasone) [19,20]. In the absence of specific available formulation for oral lesions,  super-potent  corticosteroids  (0.05% clobetasol propionate ointment) can be applied three times daily with a gloved finger on erosive lesions. It is recommended to not drink or eat for 1 h after the application. Alternatively, for widespread, less severe lesions or maintenance therapy, a patient can use a soluble prednisolone tablet 5 mg dissolved in 15 mL water for a mouthwash swish and rinse three times daily. Oral candidiasis is the most frequent complication of this treatment [21]. If no improvement is observed after 6 weeks, second line therapy has to be considered. After remission, the optimal length of maintenance therapy is unknown and should be adapted to each patient. In severe case of erosive LP associated with important eating difficulties and eventual weight loss, first line therapy is oral corticosteroids (1 mg/kg/day) until remission, generally 4-6 weeks. Slow reductions in dose are needed because of the risk of relapse. For popular plaque-like forms of oral LP, topical retinoids can be recommended as first line treatment alone or in association with topical corticosteroids. Three small RCTs compared topic retinoid (retinoic acid 0.05%, isotretinoin gel and tazarotene) with placebo.</p>
<p>Improvement or cure rates were significantly higher in the treated group [22-24].</p>
<h2>second line</h2>
<p>For erosive LP, if no or insufficient improvement is observed after topical corticosteroids, second line treatment is oral corticosteroids (1 mg/kg/day) until remission, generally 4-6 weeks [21].</p>
<h2>third line</h2>
<p>No superiority over topical corticosteroids was demonstrated in the  four  RCTs  comparing  oral  ciclosporin  to  topical  corticosteroids [8]. No topical formulation is available. Two trials compared tacrolimus  ointment  0.1%  with  clobetasol  propionate  0.5%.  One found  a  statistically  significant  difference  favouring  tacrolimus [25], while no difference between treatments was observed in the other [26]. An RCT comparing pimecrolimus cream 1% to triamcinolone  acetonide  paste  0.1%  found  no  difference  between  the two  treatments  [27].  Topical  calcineurin  inhibitors  (ciclosporin, pimecrolimus and tacrolimus) have thus not demonstrated their superiority  over  topical  corticosteroids.  Current  US  Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  labelling  states  that  topical  pimecrolimus and tacrolimus should not be used to treat premalignant onditions. They have to be used with caution in oral LP due to the c inherent risk of malignant transformation.</p>

<h2>First line</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Symptomatic oral LP : very potent corticosteroids (clobetasol propionate ointment 0.05%) three times daily until remission, then maintenance therapy</li>
<li>· Potent  topical  corticosteroids  can  be  used  in  less  severe forms of LP or during maintenance therapy: soluble prednisolone tablets, 5 mg in 15 mL water for mouthwash three times daily for widespread oral LP. An alternative to prednisolone tablets is betamethasone soluble tablets (Betnesol) 0.5 mg</li>

</ul>
<p>Adapted from Le Cleach and Chosidow 2012 [ 1 ].</p>
<p>Several others treatments were assessed in RCTs (curcuminoids, hyaluronic  acid,  ignatia,  purslane,  oral  lycopene,  intralesional injection of the polysaccharide nucleic acid fraction of BCG, thalidomide, Aloe vera gel)  [28-34]. A pooled estimate for the mean clinical score of two RCTs comparing topical Aloe vera with placeo was risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 1.10-1.62) [35,36] and one  RCT  comparing Aloe  vera gel  with  triamcinolone  acetonide paste  0.1%  found  no  difference  between  the  groups  [37].  These treatments are not recommended for the treatment of oral LP.</p>
<h2>ano-genital lichen planus</h2>
<p>Early super-potent corticosteroid treatment (0.05% clobetasol propionate ointment once daily) aims to resolve symptoms and prevent synechiae and scarring of the genital area, although efficacy for the prevention of scars or relapses has not been demonstrated. Hydrocortisone suppositories, foam or cream every other day is used for vaginal localization. Potent corticosteroids can be used daily during the initial phase until symptom resolution [6]. The frequency of application during maintenance treatment and its duration should be adapted according to evolution. Foreskin retraction or removal surgery in uncircumcised men and vaginal dilators in women are used to prevent synechiae formation. Surgery is required after complete resolution of the active lesions if adhesion occurs.</p>
<h2>Lichen planopilaris</h2>
<p>In  order  to  lessen  pain  and  pruritus,  and  to  avoid  irreversible alopecia, first line treatment is potent corticosteroids (e.g. 0.05% clobetasol propionate ointment twice daily). In severe cases or in cases  of  insufficient  improvement  after  corticosteroid  ointment, second line treatment is monthly intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetonide (0.5-10 mg/mL) or systemic oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day) [6,37,38].</p>
<h2>Frontal fibrosing alopecia</h2>
<p>Treatments can be of limited efficacy but several options have been proposed including topical and intralesional corticosteroids, antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine, topical and oral immunomodulators, tacrolimus and 5 α -reductase inhibitors [38,39].</p>
<h2>Nail lichen planus</h2>
<p>Evidence for nail LP is based only on retrospective case series and depends on the number of affected nails. The aims of treatment are to reduce pain and avoid irreversible nail scars. Two-thirds of 142 patients treated with intramuscular injection or oral systemic glucocorticoids and/or intralesional injection or topical glucocorticoids during 6 months were cured or had a major improvement [4,40].</p>
<p>When less than four nails are involved, the recommended treatment is a twice daily application of super-potent corticosteroids (e.g. 0.05% clobetasol propionate ointment), or if lesions are more severe, monthly intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetonide (0.5-10 mg/mL) in the periungual sites.</p>
<p>When  more  than  two  or  three  nails  are  involved,  systemic orticosteroids  are  required.  Treatment  with  oral  prednisolone c (0.5-1 mg/kg/day) for 4-66 weeks or intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide injection have been reported. Etanercept has been suggested in a case report [41], although LP-like eruptions can be triggered by tumour necrosis factor antagonists [42].</p>
<h2>Severe erosive lichen planus</h2>
<p>Systemic  corticosteroids  are  first  line  treatment  [ 7 ]. Systemic immunosuppressive  agents  (e.g.  azathioprine,  mycophenolate mofetil  and  methotrexate)  are  used  as  corticosteroid-sparing agents for patients with erosive or potentially scarring LP requiring prolonged systemic corticosteroids or in disease unresponsive to  corticosteroids.  Complete  remission  was  obtained  following sessions of extracorporeal photochemotherapy in 16 of 19 patients in two prospective series of patients with resistant severe erosive LP [43,44].</p>
<h2>Lichen nitidus</h2>
<p>As the disease is often asymptomatic and eventually self-  limiting, no treatment is required in most cases. However, fluorinated topical corticosteroid preparations may be recommended if treatment is  demanded,  for  example  for  lesions  on  the  penis,  and  can  be highly successful [45]. Clearance of generalized lichen nitidus has been described with sun exposure [46], PUVA [47], narrow-band UVB  phototherapy  [48,49]  and  astemizole  [50,51].  Acitretin  can lead to a gradual improvement in palmoplantar lichen nitidus [52].</p>
<h2>Nékam disease/keratosis lichenoides chronica</h2>
<p>The course of the dermatosis is chronic and progressive and very resistant  to  therapeutic  approaches,  but  has  shown  a  favourable response to photochemotherapy without [53,54] or with [55] acitretin. Etretinate [56] and photodynamic therapy [57] have been reported to be helpful.</p>
<h2>'Mixed' lichen planus/discoid lupus erythematosus disease patterns</h2>
<p>Both ciclosporin [58] and acitretin [59] can be of benefit in treating LP/DLE overlap syndrome.</p>
<h2>actinic lichen planus</h2>
<p>Actinic LP has been treated with acitretin and topical corticosteroids [60] and with ciclosporin [61].</p>
<h2>Bullous lichen planus and lichen planus pemphigoides</h2>
<p>Some cases require treatment with systemic steroids or azathioprine and fatalities can occur [60]. A combination of corticosteroids and acitretin has been used [61,62].</p>
<h2>Lichen striatus</h2>
<h2>Definition and nomenclature</h2>
<p>Lichen striatus is a distinctive, usually self-limiting and asymptomatic inflammatory dermatosis characterized by pink or red papules in a linear distribution that develop in the lines of Blaschko. These usually occur as isolated lesions on the limbs in children aged 5-15 years and generally resolve over 6-12 months. Areas of  post-inflammatory  hypopigmentation  may  occur  and  persist for longer. The aetiology is incompletely understood but approximately 40% of cases have a background of atopy. Clustering of cases in families and in winter suggests an infectious agent; potentially, a virus may be involved.</p>

<h2>epidemiology</h2>
<h2>Incidence and prevalence</h2>
<p>The incidence  or  prevalence  is  unknown,  but,  between  January 1989 and January 2000, 115 cases were identified at the Paediatric Dermatology Unit, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy [ 1 ].</p>
<h2>age</h2>
<p>Over 50% of cases occur in children, usually between the ages of 5 and 15 years, but onset in early infancy and in adults has been reported.</p>
<h2>Sex</h2>
<p>Females  are  affected  approximately  two  to  three  times  as  frequently as males [ 1 ].</p>
<h2>associated diseases</h2>
<p>Lichen striatus occurs more often in individuals with atopy; atopy was reported in approximately 43% of cases in a recent series [ 2 ].</p>
<h2>pathophysiology</h2>
<p>As the condition develops in the lines of Blaschko, which represent embryonic migratory patterns of ectoderm (see Chapter 7), it has been hypothesized that post-zygotic mutation or loss of heterozygosity may lead to cutaneous mosaicism and play a role in its pathophysiology, perhaps predisposing to the effects of an environmental trigger or an infectious agent. The presence of atopy in approximately 40% of cases is therefore intriguing. On the other hand, the resolution of lichen stratus over a period of months in the majority of cases suggests a temporary phenomenon, leading to the proposal of cutaneous antigenic mosaicism and a localized inflammatory  T-cell  response,  again  potentially  related  to  viral infection or injury [3].</p>
<h2>pathology</h2>
<p>The  histological  appearances  are  variable  and  depend  on  the stage  of  disease  [3].  Usually,  a  band-like  infiltrate  composed  of lymphocytes and histiocytes is observed with associated overlying epidermal change including parakeratosis and hyperkeratosis, resembling lichen planus. The earliest change is intercellular oedema, stretching the tonofilament-desmosome complexes and separating  the  epidermal  cells.  Like  the  spongiosis,  acanthosis is  variable  in  degree.  Dyskeratotic  keratinocytes,  like  the  'corps ronds' of Darier disease, are seen in about 50% of cases. There is often focal liquefactive degeneration of the basal layer. The dermis is oedematous, and the vessels and appendages are surrounded by an infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes, which may be quite</p>
<p>dense and extend deeply. Scattered lymphocyte cells often penetrate into the epidermis.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemical studies have revealed a predominance of CD8  T cells compared with CD4 + + T cells [3,4].</p>
<h2>Genetics</h2>
<p>Familial  cases  are  documented  [ 1 ,5,6],  although  whether  this relates to clustering related to contact with a common infectious agent remains to be determined.</p>
<h2>environmental factors</h2>
<p>Possible triggering factors include infectious agents and trauma. For example, in a retrospective case review of 115 cases from Italy, the  majority  occurred  in  the  cold  season,  five  had  prodromal symptoms of viral infection and two had a preceding history of skin trauma [ 1 ]. Other reported triggers include varicella infection [7] and measles, mumps and rubella vaccination [3].</p>
<h2>Clinical features</h2>
<h2>history</h2>
<p>The onset is usually sudden. Frequently, there are no symptoms, but  pruritus  may  occasionally  occur  and  is  more  common  in adults. The course is variable. The area affected typically reaches its  maximum  extent  within  2-3  weeks,  but  gradual  extension can continue for several months. Spontaneous resolution can be expected within 6-12 months in most cases, but some lesions may persist for over a year [8]. Resolution may be followed by hypopigmentation or more rarely hyperpigmentation [ 1 2 , ].</p>
<h2>presentation</h2>
<p>The initial  presentation  is  characterized  by  the  sudden  appearance of small, discrete, pink, flat-topped, lichenoid papules in a typical linear distribution. In a recent series of 24 patients from Spain,  11  presented  with  erythematous  papules  [ 2 ].  Occasionally,  vesicles  are  observed,  but  were  present  in  only  two  out  of 24 patients. The lesions extend over the course of a week or more and rapidly coalesce to form a dull-red to brown, slightly scaly, linear band, usually 2 mm to 2 cm in width, and often irregular. Occasionally, the bands broaden into plaques, especially on the buttocks. The lesion may be only a few centimetres in length or may extend the entire length of the limb, and may be continuous or interrupted (Figure 37.28).</p>
<p>The initial lichenoid papules are pink and not violaceous, and show no umbilication or Wickham's striae. The papules may be hypopigmented  in  dark-skinned  people  and  hypopigmentation was noted at presentation in one-third of 24 cases reported from Spain [ 2 ].  Residual persistent hypopigmentation was also noted in approximately 30% of cases in a review of over 190 patients [ 2 ]. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is reported less commonly (approximately 7% of 135 reported cases) [ 2 ].</p>
<p>The lesions occur most commonly on one arm or leg, or on the neck, but may develop on the trunk [ 1 ]. A review of more than 300 cases showed that over 75% occurred on the limbs [ 2 ].  The abdomen, buttocks and thighs may be involved in single extensive lesions, but multiple lesions are rare, and bilateral involvement is</p>

<h2>Differential diagnosis</h2>
<p>Linear inflammatory eruptions that are distributed along Blaschko's  lines  or  show  a  zosteriform  distribution,  including linear  psoriasis,  linear  Darier  disease,  linear  lichen  planus,  linear  porokeratosis  and  inflammatory  linear  verrucous  epidermal naevus  (ILVEN),  should  be  considered  in  the  differential  diagnosis. Linear forms of lichen planus and psoriasis can usually be differentiated clinically, even in the absence of typical lesions in other sites, which should always be sought. ILVEN (Chapter 75), in particular, has many clinical and histological features in common with lichen striatus. However, ILVEN is always pruritic and persists despite periods of relative improvement. The differential diagnosis  of  hypopigmented  lesions  includes  linear  vitiligo  or nevoid hypomelanosis [ 2 ].</p>
<h2>Disease course and prognosis</h2>
<p>The disease course is variable. The majority of lesions last for at least  6  months  and  resolve  within  1  year,  but  lesions  may  last for just a few weeks or persist for several years, both in children and in adults [ 1 ,8]. It may follow a prolonged and/or relapsing course, particularly in adults [ 1 ,10]. Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation may last for years, particularly in darker skin types2. Hypopigmentation may also be the presenting feature in some patients  [ 2 ].  Lichen  striatus  presenting  in  adults  tends  to  be more extensive and symptomatic and may require treatment (see below) [10].</p>
<h2>Investigations</h2>
<p>Skin biopsy may be helpful.</p>
<h2>Management</h2>
<h2>General principles of management</h2>
<p>Usually no treatment is necessary in childhood cases which are largely  asymptomatic  and  typically  spontaneously  resolve.  In patients with troublesome itch (usually adults), topical corticosteroids  are  the  first  line  of  management.  However,  in  resistant cases  or  when  there  are  concerns  over  topical  corticosteroidinduced skin atrophy, calcineurin inhibitors may be considered. Because of the rarity of the condition, no trials have been performed, but individual case reports and small case series report positive  and  prompt  symptomatic  response  and  rapid  resolution of lesions in response to both tacrolimus and pimecrolimus [4,10,11]. A single case of a response to photodynamic therapy is reported [12]. Nail involvement may respond to potent steroid cream under occlusion.</p>

<h2>Defi  nition and nomenclature</h2>
<p>Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a multiorgan disease process that results from the action of donor-derived immunocompetent T  lymphocytes  against  antigens  expressed  on  the  cells  of  the immunocompromised recipient host. The main organs affected are the skin, liver and gastrointestinal (GI) tract.</p>
<p>family member or unrelated donor) is used widely for haematological  malignancies,  but  also  immunodefi  ciences  and  marrow failure syndromes. The procedure is increasingly being considered for  other  life-threatening  conditions  such  as  multiple  sclerosis, Crohn disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis [  3,4  ].</p>
<p>GvHD is a major complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with an incidence of 25-80% [ 1 2 , . The exact risk ] depends on factors such as the degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) disparity between donor and host, the conditioning regimen intensity and the GvHD prophylaxis used.</p>
<p>There  are  two  major  forms  of  GvHD,  acute  and  chronic,  that were originally defi  ned according to the time of presentation. An overlap variant of these two forms is also described. GvHD can also occur after transfusions of unirradiated blood, such as donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), solid-organ transplants and maternofetal lymphocyte engraftment.</p>
<h2>ynonyms and inclusions S</h2>
<ul>
<li>•    Acute graft-versus-host disease, acute GvHD (aGvHD)</li>
<li>•    Chronic graft-versus-host disease, chronic GvHD (cGvHD)</li>
<li>•    GvHD overlap syndrome, sometimes called acute on chronic GvHD</li>
</ul>
<h2>ntroduction and general description I</h2>
<p>Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; transplantation of multipotent stem cells, usually derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood, from either a</p>
<p>GvHD is the major cause of morbidity and non-relapse-related mortality  following  allogeneic  HSCT.  In  most  patients,  the  fi  rst and most common site affected by GvHD is the skin.</p>
<p>GvHD has classically been divided into acute and chronic based on time of onset:</p>
<ul>
<li>•    aGvHD - disease presenting within the fi  rst 100 days of HSCT.</li>
<li>•    cGvHD - disease onset after 100 days of HSCT.</li>
</ul>
<p>However,  clinicians  now  prefer  to  defi  ne  acute  and  chronic GvHD based on their  disctinctive  clinical  features  of  these  diseases rather than a specifi  c time-point post-transplant. An overlap syndrome for GvHD is also included in the National Institutes of Health  (NIH)  consensus  diagnostic  criteria  [ 5 ]  in  which  clinical features of both acute and chronic GvHD appear together. This is sometimes referred to as acute on chronic GvHD.</p>
<p>For patients being treated for haematological malignancy, minimizing the GvHD without compromising the graft-versus-tumour (also known as graft-versus-leukaemia, GVL) effect is the focus of active research [  6,7  ].</p>
<h2>pidemiology E</h2>
<h2>ncidence and prevalence I</h2>
<p>Approximately 10-80% of HSCT recipients will develop aGVHD, depending  on  the  risk  factors  present  [  8  ].  Large  retrospective registry studies show recipient HLA mismatching and the use of unrelated donors confers a greater risk of aGvHD, as does gender</p>
